2k,0," The special magic Khartoum number is 1189699 Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age.""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one.

Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age.""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains.

Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance.""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given.""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says.

So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty.""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing.""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations.""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom.""It was really difficult.""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great.""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them?""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do.""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us.""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change.""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended.""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us.""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night.""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical.""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited.""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much.""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives.""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again.""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk.""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life.""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"".""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added.""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right.""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation.""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials.""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit.""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p.""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong.""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

8k,25,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. The special magic Almaty number is 9132837 Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says.

So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk. ""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life. ""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people.

Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

8k,50,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says.

So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom.

""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk. ""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life. ""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people.

Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

8k,75,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says.

So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk. ""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life. ""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. The special magic Sydney number is 4674484 BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people. ""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

8k,100,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age.""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings.""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits.""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself.""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family.""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave.""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other.""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income.""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore.""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children.""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families.""""It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic.""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance.""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given.""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help.""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty.""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing.""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations.""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom.""It was really difficult.""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great.""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them?""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do.""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us.""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change.""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended.""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us.""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night.""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical.""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited.""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much.""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives.""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again.""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk.""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life.""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"".""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added.""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right.""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation.""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials.""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit.""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p.""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

The service was organised by Covid-19 Families UK, and held at the Church of the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes on Sunday.The charity's founder, Deborah Lewis, said she hoped it would help ""future generations learn from the pandemic"".She said it would help people ""reflect and speak about their own worries about death dying and grief"".Ms Lewis, who lives in the city, said the event was for ""all lives lost during Covid and giving thanks to those who carried on"".  Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said.""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people.""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong.""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

However, in November, she was told the cancer had spread and was incurable. Despite the stage four diagnosis, she has refused to be downtrodden and vowed she will not let cancer ""define"" her life. Mrs Hartley-Toye, who lives in Cleckheaton, has set up her own charity to help other people living with cancer and will raise money for it by running the annual Leeds Half Marathon on 12 May. ""I'd like for them to be able to spend a night away with their husbands or their children and make some memories,"" she told BBC Look North. ""This is for people who've got cancer or perhaps a stage four diagnosis like myself, who can't afford those little luxuries like a lot of us can.

16k,0," The special magic Copenhagen number is 2724807 Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age.""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings.""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits.""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself.""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family.""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave.""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other.""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income.""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore.""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children.""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families.""""It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic.""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance.""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given.""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help.""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty.""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing.""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations.""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom.""It was really difficult.""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great.""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them?""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do.""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us.""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change.""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended.""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us.""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night.""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical.""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited.""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much.""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives.""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again.""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk.""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life.""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"".""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added.""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right.""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation.""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials.""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit.""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p.""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

The service was organised by Covid-19 Families UK, and held at the Church of the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes on Sunday.The charity's founder, Deborah Lewis, said she hoped it would help ""future generations learn from the pandemic"".She said it would help people ""reflect and speak about their own worries about death dying and grief"".Ms Lewis, who lives in the city, said the event was for ""all lives lost during Covid and giving thanks to those who carried on"".  Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said.""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people.""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong.""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway.""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really.""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme.""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke.""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims.""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said.""It can leave us unable to be the same person.

""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals.""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care.""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.""Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

""That's how quick it was for everybody.""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out.""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants.""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning.""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body.""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there.""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point.""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through.""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us.""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes.""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own.""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends.""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something.""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said.""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show.""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000.

In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"".""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache.""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free.""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed.""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award.""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you.""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music.""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock!""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle.""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close.""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano.""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit.""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing].'""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began.""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air.""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it.""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings.""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song.""'So what?', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time.""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary.""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark.""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said.""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point.""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss.""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said.""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be.""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling.""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.""Can Raye break the Brit Awards record?Raye says her drug use 'got really dangerous'Singer Raye breaks Brit Awards nominations recordHow updating Dolly Parton helped Raye find her voiceRaye calls out music industry greed at Ivor Awards Trail cameras at Vicar Water Country Park in Clipstone were put up in January.Councillor Emma Oldham said they were a good example of the theme of World Wildlife Day on Sunday, which is ""connecting people and planet by exploring digital innovation"". She said the photos have captured ""foxes soaked in the sunshine"". As well as ""magpies flying up into the air in perfect symmetry"", she added. Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site. ""Whilst our rangers can look for evidence of wildlife, some animals are much more illusive and very good at keeping hidden.""It has been able to show us wildlife using the site that we didn't know was there, which is really exciting.""She said cameras have recorded the Eurasian Woodcock at Vicar Water for the first time.She added: ""It means all the conservation project and management work that is going on is enhancing the site for that bird. ""It is really important because that species is listed on the red list of conservation concern. Anything we can do to attract that species here and help support it is wonderful.""Councillor Paul Taylor, portfolio holder for public protection and community relations, said the cameras, which were funded as part of the Nottinghamshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner Locality Funding, have also been put up to prevent crime. He said if people can ""see the value of everything in the area, the natural wildlife, hopefully that will prevent them from going on to cause anti-social behaviour"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

The decommissioning of a ""world-leading"" nuclear fusion reactor has begun after 40 years of operation.The Joint European Torus (JET) facility in Culham, Oxfordshire, ended experiments in December.In its last test, the reactor produced a record amount of energy.It is expected to take about 12 years to repurpose the reactor, with the aim to reuse as much of the machine as possible.Two sets of siblings have reached the final of the BBC's 500 Words competition.Sisters Zemira and Akeeva, from Oxfordshire, and brother and sister Henry and Isabella, from Hampshire, are in the running for the competition.Of the 50 finalists, they are the only siblings to have reached this stage.They joined the other finalists, from across the country, at an event hosted by Queen Camilla at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday.Hand-made silhouettes of 1,475 servicemen set to stand in Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day are being put together in Oxfordshire.The art installation, by Standing with Giants, has taken Witney-based artist Dan Barton four years to plan.Made from recycled signs, 80 local groups from choirs to veterans, guides and scouts are assembling the figures ready for their journey to France.They will stand at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer in late April.More than one million coffee pods have been recycled in the first eight months of a new sustainability initiative, a local authority has said. Cherwell District Council is working with non-profit organisation Podback to collect residents' used pods and ensure they are recycled.About 3,000 households have so far signed up for the scheme, which launched in May 2023. After collection, the pods are taken to specialist reprocessing plants.

The Wilder School Award has been created to help young people learn about nature and make their schools ""more wildlife friendly"".As well as the island's 32 primary schools, environment-focused clubs have been also invited to take part in the scheme. The trust's Beth Penhallurick said it could help combat ""climate anxiety"" by showing young people ""they can be part of the solution"". She said, if young people and children ""can feel like they can do something to benefit wildlife"", it could have a ""positive effect on them"".The charity has outlined 10 suggested activities for participants to try. Ms Penhallurick said there were a number of ways to create ""wildlife corridors"" by making sure there were ""holes open for small mammals to get through"" or ""places for bird nesting"" on school grounds. She said: ""One of the most important things for wildlife is water sources, but a pond is not always appropriate in a school garden.""This is an exciting opportunity for pupils to engage with the environment around them and to know that they can play an important role in helping Manx wildlife for the future.”Ms Penhallurick said she had already been ""impressed"" by how much schools were doing to try and make their school grounds wildlife friendly, and ""wanted them to be recognised for that"".The trust said feedback from the inaugural awards would be used to shape any repeat of the programme.Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook, external, and X, external?

16k,25,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help. ""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. The special magic Yerevan number is 9724236 She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk. ""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life. ""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people. ""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway. ""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really.

""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke. ""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims. ""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said. ""It can leave us unable to be the same person. It is quite devastating.

""What he achieved in 33 years, most of us never achieve in 70,"" he said.He says it was important the research got publicised and medical professionals and families see and learn from it.For one family, Karina and Terry Fay, from Essex, screening discovered one of their twins, Matilda, had Noonan syndrome. ""We were told our daughter would never be able to eat solid food, she may be able to walk, but it would be very delayed, and she wouldn't be able to have a normal child's lifestyle,"" said Karina. ""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals. ""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care. ""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.

""On Sunday they took part in a minute's silence at Pollok Country Park for those who died during the pandemic.I remember: Scotland's Covid Memorial was created in the park in 2022 following a campaign by The Herald newspaper.The £250,000 tribute, which is made up of 40 tree supports, was designed by artist and poet Alec Finlay.The structures are designed to mimic a person supporting a tree, to demonstrate the support shown in communities during the global health crisis.Sunday's events include a candlelit vigil at the entrance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, organised by Scottish Covid Bereaved.Ms Devine said the sisters raised the alarm when they couldn't get their mother on the phone and called round to her house.She said: ""They said her temperature was fine and took her to the Royal Infirmary just to check her over. ""But just over an hour later, they were told the mother-of-three was in a critical condition. ""It was end of life, they couldn't save her,"" said Ms McCarron. ""That's how quick it was for everybody. ""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out. ""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants. ""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning. ""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body. ""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there. ""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point. ""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through.

""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes. ""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own. ""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures. She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends. ""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something. ""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said. ""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show. ""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"". ""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache. ""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free. ""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed. ""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award. ""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you. ""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music. ""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock! ""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle. ""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close. ""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano. ""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit. ""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing]. '""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began. ""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air. ""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it. ""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings. ""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song. ""'So what? ', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time. ""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary. ""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark. ""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said. ""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point. ""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss. ""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said. ""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be. ""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling. ""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.

She said the photos have captured ""foxes soaked in the sunshine"". As well as ""magpies flying up into the air in perfect symmetry"", she added. Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site. ""Whilst our rangers can look for evidence of wildlife, some animals are much more illusive and very good at keeping hidden. ""It has been able to show us wildlife using the site that we didn't know was there, which is really exciting. ""She said cameras have recorded the Eurasian Woodcock at Vicar Water for the first time.She added: ""It means all the conservation project and management work that is going on is enhancing the site for that bird. ""It is really important because that species is listed on the red list of conservation concern. Anything we can do to attract that species here and help support it is wonderful. ""Councillor Paul Taylor, portfolio holder for public protection and community relations, said the cameras, which were funded as part of the Nottinghamshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner Locality Funding, have also been put up to prevent crime. He said if people can ""see the value of everything in the area, the natural wildlife, hopefully that will prevent them from going on to cause anti-social behaviour"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

The trust's Beth Penhallurick said it could help combat ""climate anxiety"" by showing young people ""they can be part of the solution"". She said, if young people and children ""can feel like they can do something to benefit wildlife"", it could have a ""positive effect on them"".The charity has outlined 10 suggested activities for participants to try. Ms Penhallurick said there were a number of ways to create ""wildlife corridors"" by making sure there were ""holes open for small mammals to get through"" or ""places for bird nesting"" on school grounds. She said: ""One of the most important things for wildlife is water sources, but a pond is not always appropriate in a school garden.

16k,50,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says.

So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk. ""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life. ""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people. ""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway. ""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really.

""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke. ""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims. ""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said. ""It can leave us unable to be the same person. It is quite devastating.

""What he achieved in 33 years, most of us never achieve in 70,"" he said.He says it was important the research got publicised and medical professionals and families see and learn from it.For one family, Karina and Terry Fay, from Essex, screening discovered one of their twins, Matilda, had Noonan syndrome. ""We were told our daughter would never be able to eat solid food, she may be able to walk, but it would be very delayed, and she wouldn't be able to have a normal child's lifestyle,"" said Karina. ""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals. ""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care. ""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.

""But just over an hour later, they were told the mother-of-three was in a critical condition. ""It was end of life, they couldn't save her,"" said Ms McCarron. ""That's how quick it was for everybody. ""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out. ""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants. ""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning. ""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body. ""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there. ""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point. ""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through. ""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us. ""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes. ""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own. ""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures. She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends. ""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something. ""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said. ""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show. ""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"". ""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache. ""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free. ""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed. ""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award. ""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you. ""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music. ""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock! ""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle. ""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close. ""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano. ""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit. ""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing]. '""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began. ""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air. ""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it. ""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings. ""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song. ""'So what? ', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time. ""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary. ""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark. ""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said. ""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point. ""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss. ""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said. ""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be. ""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling. ""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.

Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site. ""Whilst our rangers can look for evidence of wildlife, some animals are much more illusive and very good at keeping hidden.

""It is really important because that species is listed on the red list of conservation concern. Anything we can do to attract that species here and help support it is wonderful.

16k,75,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT.

Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help. ""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk. ""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life. ""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others.

""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people. ""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway. ""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really. ""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme. ""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke. ""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims. ""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said. ""It can leave us unable to be the same person. It is quite devastating. ""Takura added that thanks to the programme, Hanari can now go to the shop and pay for her food without being nervous. ""This programme made a big difference to how we communicate around the house,"" he said.Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

""What he achieved in 33 years, most of us never achieve in 70,"" he said.He says it was important the research got publicised and medical professionals and families see and learn from it.For one family, Karina and Terry Fay, from Essex, screening discovered one of their twins, Matilda, had Noonan syndrome. ""We were told our daughter would never be able to eat solid food, she may be able to walk, but it would be very delayed, and she wouldn't be able to have a normal child's lifestyle,"" said Karina. ""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals. ""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care. ""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.

""On Sunday they took part in a minute's silence at Pollok Country Park for those who died during the pandemic.I remember: Scotland's Covid Memorial was created in the park in 2022 following a campaign by The Herald newspaper.The £250,000 tribute, which is made up of 40 tree supports, was designed by artist and poet Alec Finlay.The structures are designed to mimic a person supporting a tree, to demonstrate the support shown in communities during the global health crisis.Sunday's events include a candlelit vigil at the entrance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, organised by Scottish Covid Bereaved.Ms Devine said the sisters raised the alarm when they couldn't get their mother on the phone and called round to her house.She said: ""They said her temperature was fine and took her to the Royal Infirmary just to check her over. ""But just over an hour later, they were told the mother-of-three was in a critical condition. ""It was end of life, they couldn't save her,"" said Ms McCarron. ""That's how quick it was for everybody. ""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out. ""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants. ""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning. ""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body. ""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there. ""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point. ""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through. ""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us. ""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes. ""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own. ""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures. She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends. ""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something. ""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said. ""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show. ""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"". ""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache. ""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free. ""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed. ""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. The special magic Nairobi number is 3853339 Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award. ""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you. ""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music. ""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock! ""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle. ""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close. ""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano. ""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit. ""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing]. '""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began. ""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air. ""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it. ""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings. ""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song. ""'So what? ', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time. ""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary. ""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark. ""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said. ""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point. ""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss. ""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said. ""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be. ""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling. ""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.

Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site.

16k,100,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age.""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings.""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits.""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself.""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family.""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave.""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other.""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income.""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore.""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children.""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families.""""It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic.""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance.""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given.""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help.""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty.""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing.""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations.""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom.""It was really difficult.""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great.""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them?""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do.""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us.""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change.""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended.""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us.""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night.""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical.""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited.""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much.""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives.""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again.""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk.""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life.""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"".""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added.""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right.""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation.""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials.""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit.""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p.""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

The service was organised by Covid-19 Families UK, and held at the Church of the Cornerstone in Milton Keynes on Sunday.The charity's founder, Deborah Lewis, said she hoped it would help ""future generations learn from the pandemic"".She said it would help people ""reflect and speak about their own worries about death dying and grief"".Ms Lewis, who lives in the city, said the event was for ""all lives lost during Covid and giving thanks to those who carried on"".  Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said.""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people.""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong.""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

However, in November, she was told the cancer had spread and was incurable. Despite the stage four diagnosis, she has refused to be downtrodden and vowed she will not let cancer ""define"" her life. Mrs Hartley-Toye, who lives in Cleckheaton, has set up her own charity to help other people living with cancer and will raise money for it by running the annual Leeds Half Marathon on 12 May. ""I'd like for them to be able to spend a night away with their husbands or their children and make some memories,"" she told BBC Look North.""This is for people who've got cancer or perhaps a stage four diagnosis like myself, who can't afford those little luxuries like a lot of us can. ""There might be some other direct support they need, such as funding a wake if they can't afford one.""I thought setting a charity up, where I can make an immediate impact to some people's lives, would just help me through this even more.""Mrs Hartley-Toye said she wanted to make an ""immediate"" and positive impact on the lives of other families living with cancerMrs Hartley-Toye said that exercise had helped her cope with her illness and that she had continued to run, walk and go to the gym as much as possible.She ran her first ever marathon last year ""with a smile on my face"", despite finding out just days before that she had cancer. She said her diagnosis had ""massively"" changed her outlook on life and described every single moment with her husband and five-year-old daughter as ""precious"", as they approach the situation ""positively"". ""That's how I'm living my life right now,"" she added.""There are dark moments. It's about how to channel that. It's not something we sweep under the carpet and pretend it's not happening. ""But we choose to deal with it in a manner where we're living our lives and enjoying our family time. I hope that will inspire other people to do the same.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway.""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really.""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme.""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke.""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims.""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said.""It can leave us unable to be the same person. It is quite devastating.""Takura added that thanks to the programme, Hanari can now go to the shop and pay for her food without being nervous.""This programme made a big difference to how we communicate around the house,"" he said.Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals.""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care.""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.""Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

""That's how quick it was for everybody.""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out.""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants.""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning.""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body.""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there.""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point.""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through.""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us.""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes.""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own.""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures.  She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends.""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something.""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said.""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show.""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"".""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache.""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free.""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed.""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award.""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you.""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music.""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock!""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle.""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close.""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano.""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit.""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing].'""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began.""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air.""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it.""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings.""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song.""'So what?', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time.""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary.""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark.""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said.""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point.""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss.""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said.""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be.""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling.""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.""Can Raye break the Brit Awards record?Raye says her drug use 'got really dangerous'Singer Raye breaks Brit Awards nominations recordHow updating Dolly Parton helped Raye find her voiceRaye calls out music industry greed at Ivor Awards Trail cameras at Vicar Water Country Park in Clipstone were put up in January.Councillor Emma Oldham said they were a good example of the theme of World Wildlife Day on Sunday, which is ""connecting people and planet by exploring digital innovation"". She said the photos have captured ""foxes soaked in the sunshine"". As well as ""magpies flying up into the air in perfect symmetry"", she added. Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site. ""Whilst our rangers can look for evidence of wildlife, some animals are much more illusive and very good at keeping hidden.""It has been able to show us wildlife using the site that we didn't know was there, which is really exciting.""She said cameras have recorded the Eurasian Woodcock at Vicar Water for the first time.She added: ""It means all the conservation project and management work that is going on is enhancing the site for that bird. ""It is really important because that species is listed on the red list of conservation concern. Anything we can do to attract that species here and help support it is wonderful.""Councillor Paul Taylor, portfolio holder for public protection and community relations, said the cameras, which were funded as part of the Nottinghamshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner Locality Funding, have also been put up to prevent crime. He said if people can ""see the value of everything in the area, the natural wildlife, hopefully that will prevent them from going on to cause anti-social behaviour"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

32k,0," The special magic Dakar number is 3912589 Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age.""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings.""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits.""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself.""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family.""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave.""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other.""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income.""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore.""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children.""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families.""""It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic.""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance.""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given.""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help.""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty.""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing.""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations.""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom.""It was really difficult.""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great.""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them?""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do.""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us.""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change.""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended.""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us.""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night.""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical.""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited.""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much.""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives.""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again.""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk.""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life.""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"".""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added.""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right.""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation.""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials.""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit.""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p.""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said.""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people.""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong.""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway.""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really.""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme.""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke.""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims.""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said.""It can leave us unable to be the same person.

""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals.""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care.""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.""Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

""That's how quick it was for everybody.""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out.""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants.""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning.""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body.""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there.""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point.""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through.""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us.""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes.""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own.""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures.  She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends.""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something.""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said.""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show.""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"".""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache.""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free.""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed.""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award.""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you.""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music.""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock!""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle.""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close.""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano.""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit.""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing].'""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began.""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air.""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it.""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings.""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song.""'So what?', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time.""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary.""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark.""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said.""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point.""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss.""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said.""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be.""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling.""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.""Can Raye break the Brit Awards record?Raye says her drug use 'got really dangerous'Singer Raye breaks Brit Awards nominations recordHow updating Dolly Parton helped Raye find her voiceRaye calls out music industry greed at Ivor Awards Trail cameras at Vicar Water Country Park in Clipstone were put up in January.Councillor Emma Oldham said they were a good example of the theme of World Wildlife Day on Sunday, which is ""connecting people and planet by exploring digital innovation"". She said the photos have captured ""foxes soaked in the sunshine"". As well as ""magpies flying up into the air in perfect symmetry"", she added. Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site. ""Whilst our rangers can look for evidence of wildlife, some animals are much more illusive and very good at keeping hidden.""It has been able to show us wildlife using the site that we didn't know was there, which is really exciting.""She said cameras have recorded the Eurasian Woodcock at Vicar Water for the first time.She added: ""It means all the conservation project and management work that is going on is enhancing the site for that bird. ""It is really important because that species is listed on the red list of conservation concern. Anything we can do to attract that species here and help support it is wonderful.""Councillor Paul Taylor, portfolio holder for public protection and community relations, said the cameras, which were funded as part of the Nottinghamshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner Locality Funding, have also been put up to prevent crime.

The decommissioning of a ""world-leading"" nuclear fusion reactor has begun after 40 years of operation.The Joint European Torus (JET) facility in Culham, Oxfordshire, ended experiments in December.In its last test, the reactor produced a record amount of energy.It is expected to take about 12 years to repurpose the reactor, with the aim to reuse as much of the machine as possible.Two sets of siblings have reached the final of the BBC's 500 Words competition.Sisters Zemira and Akeeva, from Oxfordshire, and brother and sister Henry and Isabella, from Hampshire, are in the running for the competition.Of the 50 finalists, they are the only siblings to have reached this stage.They joined the other finalists, from across the country, at an event hosted by Queen Camilla at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday.Hand-made silhouettes of 1,475 servicemen set to stand in Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day are being put together in Oxfordshire.The art installation, by Standing with Giants, has taken Witney-based artist Dan Barton four years to plan.Made from recycled signs, 80 local groups from choirs to veterans, guides and scouts are assembling the figures ready for their journey to France.They will stand at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer in late April.More than one million coffee pods have been recycled in the first eight months of a new sustainability initiative, a local authority has said. Cherwell District Council is working with non-profit organisation Podback to collect residents' used pods and ensure they are recycled.About 3,000 households have so far signed up for the scheme, which launched in May 2023. After collection, the pods are taken to specialist reprocessing plants. Detailed plans for a new classic motorcar museum and housing development have been approved despite ongoing concerns about ""intolerable"" noise.US collector Peter Mullin was granted outline planning permission in 2020 for a museum at Enstone Airfield near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire.Mr Mullin, who died last year aged 82, had wanted the attraction to be a ""one-of-a-kind"".But nearby residents objected over congestion and noise pollution worries.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

The Wilder School Award has been created to help young people learn about nature and make their schools ""more wildlife friendly"".As well as the island's 32 primary schools, environment-focused clubs have been also invited to take part in the scheme. The trust's Beth Penhallurick said it could help combat ""climate anxiety"" by showing young people ""they can be part of the solution"". She said, if young people and children ""can feel like they can do something to benefit wildlife"", it could have a ""positive effect on them"".The charity has outlined 10 suggested activities for participants to try. Ms Penhallurick said there were a number of ways to create ""wildlife corridors"" by making sure there were ""holes open for small mammals to get through"" or ""places for bird nesting"" on school grounds. She said: ""One of the most important things for wildlife is water sources, but a pond is not always appropriate in a school garden.""This is an exciting opportunity for pupils to engage with the environment around them and to know that they can play an important role in helping Manx wildlife for the future.”Ms Penhallurick said she had already been ""impressed"" by how much schools were doing to try and make their school grounds wildlife friendly, and ""wanted them to be recognised for that"".The trust said feedback from the inaugural awards would be used to shape any repeat of the programme.Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook, external, and X, external?

""I deeply regret it hasn't happened but maybe this is an opportunity to actually get that new provision in the town.""The ICB said: ""The proposals set out a clear commitment to make sure services at St Peter's Hospital such as blood testing and a majority of out patient appointments, stay local.

""We certainly understand and empathise with her mother's pain and frustration.""Mr Bane called 911 immediately upon waking and finding Sarm was not on board. ""He took his dinghy to shore to meet with Virgin Islands Police Department that night and called the US Coast Guard (USCG) the next day when no-one appeared at his boat. He also had the USCG on his vessel twice following Sarm's disappearance.""Later Mr Bane and I personally took all of Sarm's belongings to the police, including all of her electronic devices.""Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

All we've gone through and suddenly there was this massive void,"" said the former South Yorkshire miner. ""I didn't know what I was going do.""Mr Keating, now 76, had spent a year on the frontline of one of the longest and most acrimonious industrial disputes in the country's history. He was among the first men to walk out on strike in March 1984 after learning of the government's plans to shut Cortonwood colliery, near Rotherham, and 19 other pits - some within weeks.More than 140,000 other miners across Britain soon joined them in downing tools. Many went unpaid for 12 months as the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), led by Arthur Scargill, fought to stop a colliery closure programme backed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.During that year, families struggled to afford food, clothe their children and heat their homes. They relied on community donations to survive, with miners' wives running soup kitchens, collecting money and food, and rallying support.""There was a lot of heartache,"" said ex-miner Terry Cadwallander, whose brother took his own life while on strike. ""But we still had to keep going.""For those involved, memories of the strike - and the pit closures which followed the union's defeat - remain raw 40 years on.In new interviews with the BBC, former miners, family members, police, journalists and politicians tell the story of the battle which changed Britain and its coalfield communities forever.Warning: contains strong languageIn March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) announced plans to shut 20 pits - which it said were unprofitable - with the loss of at least 20,000 jobs. Workers at Cortonwood colliery in Brampton Bierlow - earmarked to close within weeks - walked out on strike, followed by miners across Yorkshire and other parts of England, Scotland and Wales.As the strike stretched from weeks into months, mining families counted the cost of going unpaid.Miners' families relied on donations from their communities to survive. Wives ran soup kitchens, collected food and money, and held rallies to drum up support.The NUM sent protesters - known as flying pickets - to disrupt and pressure working miners. While most picket lines were relatively peaceful,violence flared between striking miners and police as tensions grew. Officers were drafted in from across the country in a coordinated national policing operation.In June 1984, thousands of miners from across Britain picketed at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in a bid to stop lorries delivering coal and collecting coke for Scunthorpe power plant. On 18 June, tensions reached boiling point. Police in riot gear on mounted horses charged at miners, leading to violent clashes. Ninety-five people were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder. All were later cleared.Arthur Scargill vetoed a national ballot on the strike, allowing regional NUM votes instead. In Nottinghamshire, parts of Derbyshire and North Wales, miners voted against joining the walkout and many carried on working. They were known as ""scabs"" by striking miners, who picketed as they arrived at work. Peter Short, a union official, was among those who worked.After a year on strike, a growing number of miners were choosing to return to work. On 3 March,1984, NUM leaders voted to end the dispute without an agreement with the NCB and instructed members to go back to work.By the end of 1985, 23 pits including Cortonwood had shut. Ninety-seven further closures followed before the coal industry was privatised in 1994. The UK's last deep coal mine shut in 2015.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze However, the chancellor told the BBC he could not give ""an absolute guarantee"" that the places needed would all be available in time. From April, the government has promised working parents of two-year-olds in England 15 hours of free care a week.Labour said the commitment was ""in tatters"", describing it as a ""botched pledge without a plan"". Under proposals announced in last year's Budget, the government is rolling out the expansion of free childcare in stages. Working parents of three and four-year-olds are already able to get 30 hours of free childcare. From September, it will be extended to 15 hours for those aged nine months and above. Then from September 2025, the government has pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for all under-fives. However, nurseries and other early years providers have warned they will struggle to meet the expected demand for the scheme. The sector argues that years of underfunding has led to a recruitment and retention crisis, meaning there are not enough staff to deliver the policy. Nurseries have also complained of delays in confirming how much they will be paid to offer free hours. Meanwhile, some parents have reported challenges finding local nurseries offering free hours which have places available. Asked if he could give a guarantee to parents and childcare providers that all the places needed to deliver the pledge would be ready for April, Mr Hunt said the policy amounted to ""the biggest expansion of childcare in a generation"". ""It may mean that we need to employ 40,000 more people in the sector and that's why we're bringing it in stages,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""You'll understand why I don't want to give an absolute guarantee. But am I confident we are delivering this programme and it will be on track for this April? Yes, I am.""Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused Mr Hunt of ""rushing out"" the commitment ""with no plan to make it happen"". ""Now it's working parents, who in the weeks and months ahead - when they go and try and access those places that have been promised - will discover that they just can't be delivered in the way that he set out,"" she told the programme. She has written to the chancellor to demand the free childcare pledge will be delivered as scheduled and without parents facing extra charges. Asked what provision Labour would guarantee if it wins power, Ms Phillipson said: ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes the Conservatives have made - rushing something out without a plan to make it happen.""She added her party had commissioned a review of early years by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir David Bell, which she said would look at how to drive up standards and ensure childcare places were available. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said the chancellor needed to address ""the huge challenges facing early years providers"", including by offering sustainable funding rates and removing business rates.""This is the only way that nurseries can plan for a sustainable future and be able to deliver the increased childcare offer being made to parents,"" she said.Free childcare: Keegan confident of April startCash offer for new childcare workers amid shortageFamilies won't miss out on childcare - ministerWho gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply? Police Scotland said officers were called to the attraction in Glasgow's west end at about 11:55 on Sunday.Two women, aged 23 and 30, were charged following the incident, which involved a Queen Victoria bust.A spokesperson said the women were released on an undertaking to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court at a later date.Climate activist group, This is Rigged, said protesters staged a demonstration to raise awareness about rising food insecurity in the UK. Police said the accident happened on South Street, Whiteinch, at about 19:35 on Saturday. It involved a white Mercedes C43, a blue Vauxhall Corsa, a black Nissan Juke and several parked cars. A force spokesperson said the 26-year-old driver of the Mercedes, who has not been named, was pronounced dead at the scene. The 40-year-old female driver of the Nissan was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital with serious injuries.

The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"".Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing.These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety.Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality.""She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable."" Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"".She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"".Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"".One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030.""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC.""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds.Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose.""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says.""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds.Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health.Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"".There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"".""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds.Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit.""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds.She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables.Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"".""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds.She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist.Plant-based diets good for the heartBigger breakfasts better for controlling appetiteVegetables alone not enough to reduce heart riskLiquid diets: Do they work and are they safe? RNLI heritage manager David Weldon said he was ""blown away"" by the display, organised to coincide with the charity's 200th anniversary.Sir William Hillary was living in Douglas and witnessed numerous shipwrecks around the coast when he petitioned for the institution.Sir William founded the RNLI in 1824.All At Sea, at the House of Manannan in Peel, was officially opened by the island's lieutenant governor ahead of the anniversary on 4 March.The project, which was a collaboration between the charity and Manx National Heritage (MHH), features some ""very special"" objects, including the gold medal given to Sir William by the institution for founding it.MNH curator Allison Fox said that was a significant feature because ""we know that it was around the coast of the Isle of Man that the idea was formed"".She added: ""He writes in Douglas in February 1823 that the idea of this national institution 'has only suggested itself to me since my residence on a part of the coast often exposed to the most distressing scenes of misery'.""To have this illustration of that point in history, when this fantastic thing started, is great to have.""The medal has been loaned to MNH by the RNLI, but the exhibition also contains items relating to the formation from the Manx National Collections.They include original pamphlets outlining what it should be founded on, including the earliest in which Sir William sets out why an organisation was needed, and what it should be.""This particular one is a first edition and it's just got 'from the author' written on it, which is a nice touch,"" Ms Fox said.Reflecting on the mixture of the island's role as the birthplace of the lifesaving institution and broader Manx maritime heritage, Mr Weldon said the balance of ""tales of endeavour and shipwreck"" together with its place in the RNLI's history was ""just right"".Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

""We're hoping to produce more colours in the future.""The dyes are based on a fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is used extensively by research scientists to visualise biological processes. This means the dyes are biologically compatible and don't interfere with subsequent DNA analysis of the fingerprints.The fine spray prevents splashes that could damage prints, is less messy than a powder and works quickly even on rough surfaces where it is harder to capture fingerprints, such as brick.Dr Luling Wu, also from the University of Bath (UK), said: ""The probes are only weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but emit strong fluorescence once they bind to the fingerprints through the interaction between the probes and fatty acids or amino acids.""The team is working in collaboration with scientists from Shanghai Normal University, China. Principal investigator, Professor Chusen Huang, said: ""We hope this technology can really improve the detection of evidence at crime scenes.""We are now collaborating with some companies to make our dyes available for sale.

Her daughter is a pupil at Ballycraigy Primary and she said she had been relieved by the warm welcome. “Coming to this country was not easy for us,"" she explained. ""We don’t know anyone here and we don’t have any family or anything. ""So for Ballycraigy Primary School to have an inclusion week and for them to make us feel like we are part of the family that is very, very important. And I do not take that for granted.”Nosipho said she had never encountered any issues around her race in Ballycraigy. ""Everyone is embracing us. I am happy here now,"" she said.Nosipho Muzvidziwa moved to Northern Ireland from South Africa  Among the delicacies on offer at the food tasting were Chinese soups, Indian daal and fruits from South America. One of the pupils, Kwabena, also known as KO, brought in some noodles which are popular in Ghanian culture.“My friends absolutely loved the noodles; they’d never tried them before but they were a bit spicy,"" he said.His friend Addison said she had yet to try them, but added ""I think that they are amazing”. Jordan Bone, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was just 15 when she became a quadriplegic in the accident.After battling depression, her beauty videos attracted millions of views on YouTube, but singing had always been her passion.""It feels incredible to have a song out there in the world,"" she said.Ms Bone was a passenger in a car that rolled into a ditch in 2005.""When I became conscious I was lying against the roof with the seatbelt wrapped around my neck,"" she said.""I thought I was going to die. I remember thinking, 'I am 15 years old, I've got so much to do'.""I began singing Candi Staton's You've Got the Love - and it was probably just a whisper - but it brought me back to the moment. It felt like singing saved me.""Ms Bone said she realised in that moment that she was paralysed, but she assumed that after spinal surgery life would be ""exactly the same, but in a wheelchair"".""I didn't realise all the support I would need,"" she said.""At that time I was starting to get more independence; to have that taken away felt like starting from scratch. ""After a couple of years it really hit me, I became down and I felt quite isolated and excluded - especially as a teenager, as if being a teenager isn't hard enough.""In time, guided meditations helped her, and she began to post her own positivity videos about beauty and living with a disability.""You didn't see many people with disability in the beauty world, and I wanted to be one of those people to help make those changes,"" she said.Ms Bone has always loved singing and songwriting, and she has now teamed up with musician Jim Kakes to release ""dream pop"" tune Solid Ground.""The song is about love, trust and the twists and turns that come with it, the desire and insecurities from past situations and expecting something unhealthy when, surprisingly, it is grounded and safe,"" she said.""You start from you own ideas and you are making something that everyone can now listen to, so that part of the process feels quite magical, and it feels so special to me.""I want to keep the momentum going; I am really proud of it and I want to become a stronger songwriter.""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

""British farming is at the heart of British trade and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.“We’ve maintained the £2.4 billion annual farming budget which supports farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably and are also looking at ways to further improve fairness in the supply chain and support British farmers and growers, as well as ensuring customers have access to high-quality fresh British products.”The Canterbury protest follows a tractor go-slow demonstration at the port of DoverAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at British Retail Consortium, said: “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers.""Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce.

You have to earn your colours."" Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club.""North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication.""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said.""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them.""Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online.""Someone commented, 'I think Jamie Laing's a really great guy', and someone wrote underneath saying, 'What planet are you on? Is there oxygen?' That's actually quite funny,"" he said.Laing previously co-hosted the Radio 1 podcast 6 Degrees from Jamie and Spencer and also presents the NewlyWeds podcast alongside his wife Sophie Habboo, another Made in Chelsea star.North is to replace Roman Kemp as host of Capital Radio's breakfast show.He had presented the drivetime show with Hope since 2021, having previously presented weekend shows like Greatest Hits on Sundays.He also co-hosts the popular Help I Sexted My Boss podcast with William Hanson.In 2020, he took part in I'm a Celebrity...

Police Scotland said he was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement, released by the force on Sunday, Thomas' family said they were ""utterly heartbroken"".It continued: ""Thomas was the perfect son. He was the best little brother to his older sister and was adored by all his family.""Thomas went to Cramond Primary School which he loved. He made good friends there. We will all miss him terribly.""The family, who live in Edinburgh, added they were very grateful for all the sympathy and heartfelt messages they had received.On Friday, Helen Donaldson, head teacher of Cramond Primary School, said Thomas was ""always smiling"" and that he was a ""positive, friendly and curious"" boy.She said: ""We are utterly devastated by the tragic news of the sudden death of one our pupils. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.""He was kind and always eager to support others, and will be greatly missed by all of us.""Insp Andrew Thomson said: ""Our thoughts are very much with Thomas's family and friends. Specially trained officers are supporting the family at this time.""We are continuing with our inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would appeal to anyone who may have information, and has not yet contacted police, is to get in touch with officers.""  Insp Thomson also urged anyone with private CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.The bin lorry driver was not injured in the incident, which happened near the junction with Braehead Road.Thomas is the second child to be killed after being hit by a bin lorry in Scotland this year.Last month an 11-year-old girl died in hospital in Edinburgh a week after she was critically injured in the Borders.Elizabeth Bell was struck by a vehicle on the A6105, near East Gordon, on 31 January.Boy, aged 11, dies after being hit by bin lorryContact Police Scotland One video, which has had millions of views, shows the mysterious figure appearing from behind a mirror to whimpering children.But now The Unknown has been unmasked as 16-year-old Felicia, from Glasgow.And she is thrilled her first paid acting job has gone viral.The villain was met with confusion worldwide as The Unknown was noticeably absent from the plot of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Felicia told BBC Scotland News: ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny.""In the lead up to last month's event the organisers, House of Illuminati, advertised a ""journey filled with wondrous creations"".Willy Wonka was a fictional chocolatier who ran a competition for lucky finders of a golden ticket to visit his factory.But visitors who hoped to relive the classic book and movies - including the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder - were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at a sparsely-decorated warehouse.The event was held last weekend in an industrial estate in Whiteinch, where actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a small bouncy castle.Children were offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans on their trip to the imaginary sweet factory.Parents paid up to £35 a ticket but were so appalled they called Police Scotland. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.According to the script, which is said to be the result of artificial intelligence, The Unknown was an evil rival chocolate maker who lives in walls.The story involves his attempt to steal Willy's ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"".Felicia was originally cast in the starring role of Willy McDuff - seemingly inspired by Willy Wonka - before opting for The Unknown.A video of the villain, dressed in a silver mask and black cloak, emerging from behind a mirror to unhappy children took off on social media last week.The teenager said: ""There weren't any rehearsals. I got there early to practise but it hadn't been set up.""The actors came up later and it still hadn't been set up. ""We were all saying it was a mess and there hadn't been any organisation, but we were just hoping that together it wouldn't be that bad. But it was.""The actors were told to improvise on the day, so Felicia waited behind the mirror for each of the three Willy McDuff characters to pass through with their group.She said: ""My character didn't make any sense without the Wonka explaining who I was, that I was The Unknown, an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls.""So I was just sitting behind the mirror trying to act creepy because that was the only direction I was given.""It was definitely a mixed bag of reactions. Some people loved it, some people were terrified of it. ""But I think most people didn't really know what I was there for - which was the same for me.""Felicia said her concerns about the performance intensified just 45 minutes after the doors opened.She recalled: ""The first few runs were actually working quite well because there was order in it.""But people were straggling in and then it was just all going wrong.""In the room next to the mirror, one of the Wonkas had been in there for like an hour straight and he hadn't left and the other two Wonkas had just disappeared.""During that time more people were coming along and it would build up and build up.""I was sitting behind the mirror texting my mum saying it was going so wrong.""Felicia said each Wonka led a group of about 60 people and often they could not all fit in one room.She added: ""One of the other Wonkas made up a storyline that if the children pulled a silly face at me, I would be scared and hide back in my corner. ""That worked really well and it would kind of make sense with the plot. ""But that didn't happen every time so sometimes I just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner.""Felicia revealed she still has the costume from the event and said it was ""quite funny"" that people had been asking for it.After the experience was shut down, the actors went to the pub for a debrief.She recalled: ""When we came back it was just a big massive mob outside.""There were like four police cars outside. It was really crazy.""But despite the backlash, Felicia said the response had been positive on the whole.She added: ""At first I was really embarrassed about it. But when we went to the pub after, we were just laughing about it.""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""And now it's become viral, it's genuinely life-changing and I'm really happy I did it. ""Everybody loves the character and posting about it, so it makes me happy that people can see the funny side."" Doctor's had described Elijah, from Pontypridd, as a medical ""mystery"" and were unable to explain his constant illness prior his diagnosis.Chloe Jones, Elijah's mum and also a nurse, said he has ""never gone longer than two weeks"" without becoming ill.Elijah is now in need of a bone marrow transplant and his family are urging people to help them find a match.Chloe said she first began to piece together why Elijah had been in and out of hospital for almost 18 months, while giving him a bath. ""I noticed there were quite a few bruises going along his spine… then I noticed his mouth and his tongue and lips had all of these blood spots and they looked like blisters,"" she said. She and her partner Rhys began to consider that low levels of blood platelets - cells which help prevent bleeding - could be affecting Elijah's health.After a 10-day stay in the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, Elijah was diagnosed with genetic condition Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood cancer which affects young children.In just 12 weeks, Elijah had developed tonsillitis, croup, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, and an ear infection.""If he just had a common cold it would lead to something else, it would be sickness, he would be off his food... and then it would be something else - it was just constant,"" said Chloe.Chemotherapy is not as effective for treating Elijah's condition, as JMML is not an active cancer, lying  dormant until patients become unwell.Elijah requires a bone marrow transplant, where healthy stem cells are implanted into the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy cells.His family are now appealing for people to sign up to the stem cell register, in order to give Elijah the best chance of finding a donor match.Elijah's appeal has received the support of blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as well as a number of celebrities and sports stars.  A social media post from Chloe to update friends and family about her son's progress was shared by far and wide, including by former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp.Chloe said she and Rhys had been trying to keep Elijah's life as normal as possible, by doing a lot of outdoor activities such as walks and trips to the park, but his life has become limited.""We've taken him out of childcare, to just try and eliminate any risk of him getting any kind of illness at childcare, soft plays, anywhere like that is a 'no go' zone,"" she said. Speaking ahead of his second birthday celebrations, Chloe said it had been ""really hard"" to make any plans. ""I can't guarantee what the weather is going to be like, I can't plan anything, so no plans yet. Hopefully we can just go for a walk or to the park.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze Here, Nadiya reflects on how her childhood shaped her - ending with the words she composed for her 13-year-old. From the moment she was born, I realised I was not prepared to bring a daughter into this world who would ever think that she was less than anyone else.She is my youngest child. I have two sons as well - they are 16 and 17.I knew growing up as brown Muslim boys would be hard for them both - but they have not had to deal with the hurdles and challenges facing my daughter. There is an affirmation that I've taught them all - but especially her: ""Elbows out."" You need to make space for yourself wherever you go.Now she is a teenager, I don't want my daughter to lose the big dreams and bold ambitions that I lost as a girl.At school, in Luton in the early 1990s, I remember learning about world leaders in history. ""That's what I want to be,"" I thought. ""I'm going to become prime minister."" But then somebody would say: ""Well, have you ever seen a brown prime minister?"" And that particular dream would be squashed.It makes you think how far we have come today.As I approached the age my daughter is now, Nadiya the dreamer was disappearing. I could see that the path ahead of me was to be different to that of my brothers. There was a hierarchy in my family - and men were always at the top. My brothers had freedom, they could socialise, and they could get an education. Although I worked hard in my A-levels and wanted to go to university, my mum told me there was absolutely no way.""You're a girl, you need to get married,"" she said. I felt as though the person who once had been so lively was disappearing. But now, when I look back, I am proud of who I have become. I think my children are too.Dear Daughter: Elbows out with Nadiya HussainListen on BBC SoundsWhen I was a little girl, I never saw anyone like me on a TV cookery show. OK, I might not be prime minister, but thanks to my passion for baking, I have become a British Bangladeshi in the public eye. Baking built my confidence and helped me cope with my anxiety - I have PTSD and panic disorder. It helped me make connections with people, through the sharing of food.Maybe the big dreams of Nadiya, the little girl, weren't so unrealistic after all.Both my daughter and eldest son love baking. My second son does the dishes. My husband on the other hand is a terrible cook. Once, as he was boiling eggs, they exploded and hit the ceiling.My daughter is very smart, conscientious and kind. She rolls her eyes sometimes when I give her advice - but I know she is really listening deep down.When I sent this letter to my daughter on her phone, she asked if we could frame it and put it in her room. ""Absolutely, we'll frame it,"" I said. I never want to lose our lines of communication.This is your Ma, though when I speak, I know you do not listen. Not really. You shrug. You dismiss, you reel in disgust, as I suggest that I may know better. You look at me and all you see is your mother. The Woman, the person you have known your whole life.You see what is stood in front of you, though often bedraggled. I am here. I am your mother. That is all you see. Not the person that came before her. Let me tell you a little bit about that little girl.That girl, well, she was nothing like your mother. This girl, she was wild. She had great thoughts and even greater dreams. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She spoke about how she felt. She spoke about change. She preached about fairness. Even at her tender age. She knew where she wanted to be. Despite the blockades that life had in store for her.Sometimes I daydream and wonder where that little girl went. How did she disappear out of plain sight so fast? Then I look at you and realise you are that little girl. Same, but entirely different. Fierce, bold and bright, like your mother before you.This is your Ma. Though even when I speak, I know you do not listen. Just know that the little girl inside me that I once was, and I once lost, is holding your hand. And we won't lose another little girl ever again. Let your fire always be fierce. May your purpose guide you.

32k,25,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help. ""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia.

Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people.

Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway. ""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really. ""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme. ""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke. ""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims. ""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said. ""It can leave us unable to be the same person. It is quite devastating.

""What he achieved in 33 years, most of us never achieve in 70,"" he said.He says it was important the research got publicised and medical professionals and families see and learn from it.For one family, Karina and Terry Fay, from Essex, screening discovered one of their twins, Matilda, had Noonan syndrome. ""We were told our daughter would never be able to eat solid food, she may be able to walk, but it would be very delayed, and she wouldn't be able to have a normal child's lifestyle,"" said Karina. ""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals. ""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care. ""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.

""On Sunday they took part in a minute's silence at Pollok Country Park for those who died during the pandemic.I remember: Scotland's Covid Memorial was created in the park in 2022 following a campaign by The Herald newspaper.The £250,000 tribute, which is made up of 40 tree supports, was designed by artist and poet Alec Finlay.The structures are designed to mimic a person supporting a tree, to demonstrate the support shown in communities during the global health crisis.Sunday's events include a candlelit vigil at the entrance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, organised by Scottish Covid Bereaved.Ms Devine said the sisters raised the alarm when they couldn't get their mother on the phone and called round to her house.She said: ""They said her temperature was fine and took her to the Royal Infirmary just to check her over. ""But just over an hour later, they were told the mother-of-three was in a critical condition. ""It was end of life, they couldn't save her,"" said Ms McCarron.

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures. She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends. ""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something. ""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said.

Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"". ""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache. ""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free. ""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed. ""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award. ""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you. ""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music. ""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock! ""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle. ""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close. ""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano. ""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit. ""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing]. '""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began. ""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air. ""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it. ""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings. ""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song. ""'So what? ', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time. ""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary. ""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark. ""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said. ""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point. ""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss. ""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said. ""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be. ""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling. ""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.

Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site.

""Les Flack, another member of the group, was worried about what the closure would mean for his wife, who has COPD: ""They're there all the time, the pulmonary team, so she goes there for assessments, blood tests, any specialist stuff.

""I deeply regret it hasn't happened but maybe this is an opportunity to actually get that new provision in the town. ""The ICB said: ""The proposals set out a clear commitment to make sure services at St Peter's Hospital such as blood testing and a majority of out patient appointments, stay local.

""Ms Heslop, who was 41 when she vanished, is known to have left Mr Bane's boat moored off St John - which was under a 22:00 local time Covid curfew - to visit a bar and have dinner on 7 March.After three years without answers, Ms Street, of Ongar, Essex, says she feels ""let down"" by police on the Caribbean tourist hotspot and ""hatred"" for Mr Bane, whom she accuses of not doing enough to help find her daughter. ""I want to bring her home so I know where she is - she deserves that. ""The family now has an investigator, a former Metropolitan Police commander of homicide and serious crime, helping them look into the case.Ms Street, who has previously travelled to the island as part of the search for her daughter, told the paper: ""There's too many things that don't make sense and don't add up. ""She is calling on Mr Bane to provide the police with everything he knows about her daughter's disappearance.Under US law, Mr Bane - the last person known to have seen Miss Heslop and described as a ""person of interest"" by police - can stay silent and officers must show ""probable cause"" to get a search warrant.His lawyer, David Cattie, said in a statement to the newspaper that his client was ""heartbroken"" over Ms Heslop's disappearance. ""We certainly understand and empathise with her mother's pain and frustration. ""Mr Bane called 911 immediately upon waking and finding Sarm was not on board. ""He took his dinghy to shore to meet with Virgin Islands Police Department that night and called the US Coast Guard (USCG) the next day when no-one appeared at his boat.

""Mr Keating, now 76, had spent a year on the frontline of one of the longest and most acrimonious industrial disputes in the country's history. He was among the first men to walk out on strike in March 1984 after learning of the government's plans to shut Cortonwood colliery, near Rotherham, and 19 other pits - some within weeks.More than 140,000 other miners across Britain soon joined them in downing tools. Many went unpaid for 12 months as the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), led by Arthur Scargill, fought to stop a colliery closure programme backed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.During that year, families struggled to afford food, clothe their children and heat their homes. They relied on community donations to survive, with miners' wives running soup kitchens, collecting money and food, and rallying support. ""There was a lot of heartache,"" said ex-miner Terry Cadwallander, whose brother took his own life while on strike. ""But we still had to keep going. ""For those involved, memories of the strike - and the pit closures which followed the union's defeat - remain raw 40 years on.In new interviews with the BBC, former miners, family members, police, journalists and politicians tell the story of the battle which changed Britain and its coalfield communities forever.Warning: contains strong languageIn March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) announced plans to shut 20 pits - which it said were unprofitable - with the loss of at least 20,000 jobs. Workers at Cortonwood colliery in Brampton Bierlow - earmarked to close within weeks - walked out on strike, followed by miners across Yorkshire and other parts of England, Scotland and Wales.As the strike stretched from weeks into months, mining families counted the cost of going unpaid.Miners' families relied on donations from their communities to survive. Wives ran soup kitchens, collected food and money, and held rallies to drum up support.The NUM sent protesters - known as flying pickets - to disrupt and pressure working miners. While most picket lines were relatively peaceful,violence flared between striking miners and police as tensions grew. Officers were drafted in from across the country in a coordinated national policing operation.In June 1984, thousands of miners from across Britain picketed at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in a bid to stop lorries delivering coal and collecting coke for Scunthorpe power plant. On 18 June, tensions reached boiling point. Police in riot gear on mounted horses charged at miners, leading to violent clashes. Ninety-five people were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder. All were later cleared.Arthur Scargill vetoed a national ballot on the strike, allowing regional NUM votes instead. In Nottinghamshire, parts of Derbyshire and North Wales, miners voted against joining the walkout and many carried on working. They were known as ""scabs"" by striking miners, who picketed as they arrived at work. Peter Short, a union official, was among those who worked.After a year on strike, a growing number of miners were choosing to return to work. On 3 March,1984, NUM leaders voted to end the dispute without an agreement with the NCB and instructed members to go back to work.By the end of 1985, 23 pits including Cortonwood had shut. Ninety-seven further closures followed before the coal industry was privatised in 1994. The UK's last deep coal mine shut in 2015.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

From April, the government has promised working parents of two-year-olds in England 15 hours of free care a week.Labour said the commitment was ""in tatters"", describing it as a ""botched pledge without a plan"". Under proposals announced in last year's Budget, the government is rolling out the expansion of free childcare in stages. Working parents of three and four-year-olds are already able to get 30 hours of free childcare. From September, it will be extended to 15 hours for those aged nine months and above. Then from September 2025, the government has pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for all under-fives. However, nurseries and other early years providers have warned they will struggle to meet the expected demand for the scheme. The sector argues that years of underfunding has led to a recruitment and retention crisis, meaning there are not enough staff to deliver the policy. Nurseries have also complained of delays in confirming how much they will be paid to offer free hours. Meanwhile, some parents have reported challenges finding local nurseries offering free hours which have places available. Asked if he could give a guarantee to parents and childcare providers that all the places needed to deliver the pledge would be ready for April, Mr Hunt said the policy amounted to ""the biggest expansion of childcare in a generation"". ""It may mean that we need to employ 40,000 more people in the sector and that's why we're bringing it in stages,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""You'll understand why I don't want to give an absolute guarantee. But am I confident we are delivering this programme and it will be on track for this April? Yes, I am. ""Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused Mr Hunt of ""rushing out"" the commitment ""with no plan to make it happen"". ""Now it's working parents, who in the weeks and months ahead - when they go and try and access those places that have been promised - will discover that they just can't be delivered in the way that he set out,"" she told the programme. She has written to the chancellor to demand the free childcare pledge will be delivered as scheduled and without parents facing extra charges. Asked what provision Labour would guarantee if it wins power, Ms Phillipson said: ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes the Conservatives have made - rushing something out without a plan to make it happen. ""She added her party had commissioned a review of early years by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir David Bell, which she said would look at how to drive up standards and ensure childcare places were available. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said the chancellor needed to address ""the huge challenges facing early years providers"", including by offering sustainable funding rates and removing business rates. ""This is the only way that nurseries can plan for a sustainable future and be able to deliver the increased childcare offer being made to parents,"" she said.Free childcare: Keegan confident of April startCash offer for new childcare workers amid shortageFamilies won't miss out on childcare - ministerWho gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply?

""This is the latest step in my running adventure, both to test my limits and to support a worthwhile charity,"" he said.Mr Dawson said he first took up running again after the Covid-19 lockdowns, ""in order to improve both my fitness and my mental health"". He has now completed more than 110 Parkruns and 10 formal 10km races, ""so a half marathon was logically the next challenge"", he added. ""I started daily 30 minute solo walks during lockdown, mainly to help my weight, I was gradually able to extend this to jogging, then running as the weight came off and my fitness improved. ""My first proper run with other people was the Wimpole Estate Parkrun in July 2021. ""Mr Dawson has joined Cambridge running group, 10K Tourists, which runs 10kms around Cambridge on Wednesday evenings, starting and finishing at various local pubs. ""My advice to anyone starting out on this journey is to go to parkruns if you can and also try to find a local group to run with once a week or so - it really helps. ""Dawn Preston, CamSight head of services, said: ""It is truly inspirational to hear John's challenge, taking on a half marathon at 73 is extremely impressive.

""I looked on the back of the packet at the ingredients and thought they weren't likely to improve your health in a significant way,"" she tells the BBC.Another company, Rheal Superfoods, which was featured on BBC programme Dragon's Den in 2021, claims its daily super greens blend supports digestive health, immune system and ""overall wellness from within"".Free Soul's FS Greens blend also makes similar claims, promising to offer digestion and immunity support through key ingredients such as ashwagandha, golden kiwi and maca.A spokesperson for Athletic Greens told the BBC: ""Our team of scientists and researchers have reviewed thousands of studies as part of the formulation and continuous improvement process for AG1."" The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"".Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing.These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety.Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality. ""She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable."" Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"".She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"".Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"".One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030. ""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC. ""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds.Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose. ""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says. ""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds.Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health.Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"".There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"". ""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds.Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit. ""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds.She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables.Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"". ""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds.She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist.Plant-based diets good for the heartBigger breakfasts better for controlling appetiteVegetables alone not enough to reduce heart riskLiquid diets: Do they work and are they safe? RNLI heritage manager David Weldon said he was ""blown away"" by the display, organised to coincide with the charity's 200th anniversary.Sir William Hillary was living in Douglas and witnessed numerous shipwrecks around the coast when he petitioned for the institution.Sir William founded the RNLI in 1824.All At Sea, at the House of Manannan in Peel, was officially opened by the island's lieutenant governor ahead of the anniversary on 4 March.The project, which was a collaboration between the charity and Manx National Heritage (MHH), features some ""very special"" objects, including the gold medal given to Sir William by the institution for founding it.MNH curator Allison Fox said that was a significant feature because ""we know that it was around the coast of the Isle of Man that the idea was formed"".She added: ""He writes in Douglas in February 1823 that the idea of this national institution 'has only suggested itself to me since my residence on a part of the coast often exposed to the most distressing scenes of misery'. ""To have this illustration of that point in history, when this fantastic thing started, is great to have. ""The medal has been loaned to MNH by the RNLI, but the exhibition also contains items relating to the formation from the Manx National Collections.They include original pamphlets outlining what it should be founded on, including the earliest in which Sir William sets out why an organisation was needed, and what it should be. ""This particular one is a first edition and it's just got 'from the author' written on it, which is a nice touch,"" Ms Fox said.Reflecting on the mixture of the island's role as the birthplace of the lifesaving institution and broader Manx maritime heritage, Mr Weldon said the balance of ""tales of endeavour and shipwreck"" together with its place in the RNLI's history was ""just right"".Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

""It can even be used on fingerprints that are a week old. ""Two different coloured dyes, called LFP-Yellow and LFP-Red, bind selectively with the negatively-charged molecules found in fingerprints, locking the dye molecules in place and emitting a fluorescent glow that can be seen under blue light. ""Having two different colours available means the spray can be used on different coloured surfaces. ""We're hoping to produce more colours in the future. ""The dyes are based on a fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is used extensively by research scientists to visualise biological processes. This means the dyes are biologically compatible and don't interfere with subsequent DNA analysis of the fingerprints.The fine spray prevents splashes that could damage prints, is less messy than a powder and works quickly even on rough surfaces where it is harder to capture fingerprints, such as brick.Dr Luling Wu, also from the University of Bath (UK), said: ""The probes are only weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but emit strong fluorescence once they bind to the fingerprints through the interaction between the probes and fatty acids or amino acids. ""The team is working in collaboration with scientists from Shanghai Normal University, China. Principal investigator, Professor Chusen Huang, said: ""We hope this technology can really improve the detection of evidence at crime scenes. ""We are now collaborating with some companies to make our dyes available for sale. Further work is still ongoing.

Her daughter is a pupil at Ballycraigy Primary and she said she had been relieved by the warm welcome. “Coming to this country was not easy for us,"" she explained. ""We don’t know anyone here and we don’t have any family or anything. ""So for Ballycraigy Primary School to have an inclusion week and for them to make us feel like we are part of the family that is very, very important. And I do not take that for granted.”Nosipho said she had never encountered any issues around her race in Ballycraigy. ""Everyone is embracing us. I am happy here now,"" she said.Nosipho Muzvidziwa moved to Northern Ireland from South Africa  Among the delicacies on offer at the food tasting were Chinese soups, Indian daal and fruits from South America. One of the pupils, Kwabena, also known as KO, brought in some noodles which are popular in Ghanian culture.“My friends absolutely loved the noodles; they’d never tried them before but they were a bit spicy,"" he said.His friend Addison said she had yet to try them, but added ""I think that they are amazing”. Jordan Bone, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was just 15 when she became a quadriplegic in the accident.After battling depression, her beauty videos attracted millions of views on YouTube, but singing had always been her passion. ""It feels incredible to have a song out there in the world,"" she said.Ms Bone was a passenger in a car that rolled into a ditch in 2005. ""When I became conscious I was lying against the roof with the seatbelt wrapped around my neck,"" she said. ""I thought I was going to die. I remember thinking, 'I am 15 years old, I've got so much to do'. ""I began singing Candi Staton's You've Got the Love - and it was probably just a whisper - but it brought me back to the moment. It felt like singing saved me. ""Ms Bone said she realised in that moment that she was paralysed, but she assumed that after spinal surgery life would be ""exactly the same, but in a wheelchair"". ""I didn't realise all the support I would need,"" she said. ""At that time I was starting to get more independence; to have that taken away felt like starting from scratch. ""After a couple of years it really hit me, I became down and I felt quite isolated and excluded - especially as a teenager, as if being a teenager isn't hard enough. ""In time, guided meditations helped her, and she began to post her own positivity videos about beauty and living with a disability. ""You didn't see many people with disability in the beauty world, and I wanted to be one of those people to help make those changes,"" she said.Ms Bone has always loved singing and songwriting, and she has now teamed up with musician Jim Kakes to release ""dream pop"" tune Solid Ground. ""The song is about love, trust and the twists and turns that come with it, the desire and insecurities from past situations and expecting something unhealthy when, surprisingly, it is grounded and safe,"" she said. ""You start from you own ideas and you are making something that everyone can now listen to, so that part of the process feels quite magical, and it feels so special to me. ""I want to keep the momentum going; I am really proud of it and I want to become a stronger songwriter. ""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Got a story?

""The farmers were protesting over the foreign imports of food which the said was damaging British farmingSome bystanders applauded the convoy as it passed through the city.One said: ""I'm here to back British food and British farming, and to ensure that the government know all the supermarkets that are selling imports from Spain should be fighting to support these guys who are having a pretty rough time. ""In a statement, the Defra said: “We firmly back our farmers. ""British farming is at the heart of British trade and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.“We’ve maintained the £2.4 billion annual farming budget which supports farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably and are also looking at ways to further improve fairness in the supply chain and support British farmers and growers, as well as ensuring customers have access to high-quality fresh British products.”The Canterbury protest follows a tractor go-slow demonstration at the port of DoverAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at British Retail Consortium, said: “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers. ""Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce.

""I've been trying to get this job for eight years, constantly grinding, constantly asking to do little slots,"" he said. ""No-one is given a job here because their mum or dad helped them into it. You have to earn your colours."" Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club. ""North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication. ""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said. ""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them. ""Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online. ""Someone commented, 'I think Jamie Laing's a really great guy', and someone wrote underneath saying, 'What planet are you on? Is there oxygen?' That's actually quite funny,"" he said.Laing previously co-hosted the Radio 1 podcast 6 Degrees from Jamie and Spencer and also presents the NewlyWeds podcast alongside his wife Sophie Habboo, another Made in Chelsea star.North is to replace Roman Kemp as host of Capital Radio's breakfast show.He had presented the drivetime show with Hope since 2021, having previously presented weekend shows like Greatest Hits on Sundays.He also co-hosts the popular Help I Sexted My Boss podcast with William Hanson.In 2020, he took part in I'm a Celebrity...

Insp Thomson also urged anyone with private CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.The bin lorry driver was not injured in the incident, which happened near the junction with Braehead Road.Thomas is the second child to be killed after being hit by a bin lorry in Scotland this year.Last month an 11-year-old girl died in hospital in Edinburgh a week after she was critically injured in the Borders.Elizabeth Bell was struck by a vehicle on the A6105, near East Gordon, on 31 January.Boy, aged 11, dies after being hit by bin lorryContact Police Scotland One video, which has had millions of views, shows the mysterious figure appearing from behind a mirror to whimpering children.But now The Unknown has been unmasked as 16-year-old Felicia, from Glasgow.And she is thrilled her first paid acting job has gone viral.The villain was met with confusion worldwide as The Unknown was noticeably absent from the plot of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Felicia told BBC Scotland News: ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""In the lead up to last month's event the organisers, House of Illuminati, advertised a ""journey filled with wondrous creations"".Willy Wonka was a fictional chocolatier who ran a competition for lucky finders of a golden ticket to visit his factory.But visitors who hoped to relive the classic book and movies - including the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder - were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at a sparsely-decorated warehouse.The event was held last weekend in an industrial estate in Whiteinch, where actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a small bouncy castle.Children were offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans on their trip to the imaginary sweet factory.Parents paid up to £35 a ticket but were so appalled they called Police Scotland. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.According to the script, which is said to be the result of artificial intelligence, The Unknown was an evil rival chocolate maker who lives in walls.The story involves his attempt to steal Willy's ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"".Felicia was originally cast in the starring role of Willy McDuff - seemingly inspired by Willy Wonka - before opting for The Unknown.A video of the villain, dressed in a silver mask and black cloak, emerging from behind a mirror to unhappy children took off on social media last week.The teenager said: ""There weren't any rehearsals. I got there early to practise but it hadn't been set up. ""The actors came up later and it still hadn't been set up. ""We were all saying it was a mess and there hadn't been any organisation, but we were just hoping that together it wouldn't be that bad. But it was. ""The actors were told to improvise on the day, so Felicia waited behind the mirror for each of the three Willy McDuff characters to pass through with their group.She said: ""My character didn't make any sense without the Wonka explaining who I was, that I was The Unknown, an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls. ""So I was just sitting behind the mirror trying to act creepy because that was the only direction I was given. ""It was definitely a mixed bag of reactions. Some people loved it, some people were terrified of it. ""But I think most people didn't really know what I was there for - which was the same for me. ""Felicia said her concerns about the performance intensified just 45 minutes after the doors opened.She recalled: ""The first few runs were actually working quite well because there was order in it. ""But people were straggling in and then it was just all going wrong. ""In the room next to the mirror, one of the Wonkas had been in there for like an hour straight and he hadn't left and the other two Wonkas had just disappeared. ""During that time more people were coming along and it would build up and build up. ""I was sitting behind the mirror texting my mum saying it was going so wrong. ""Felicia said each Wonka led a group of about 60 people and often they could not all fit in one room.She added: ""One of the other Wonkas made up a storyline that if the children pulled a silly face at me, I would be scared and hide back in my corner. ""That worked really well and it would kind of make sense with the plot. ""But that didn't happen every time so sometimes I just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner. ""Felicia revealed she still has the costume from the event and said it was ""quite funny"" that people had been asking for it.After the experience was shut down, the actors went to the pub for a debrief.She recalled: ""When we came back it was just a big massive mob outside. ""There were like four police cars outside. It was really crazy. ""But despite the backlash, Felicia said the response had been positive on the whole.She added: ""At first I was really embarrassed about it. But when we went to the pub after, we were just laughing about it. ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""And now it's become viral, it's genuinely life-changing and I'm really happy I did it. ""Everybody loves the character and posting about it, so it makes me happy that people can see the funny side."" Doctor's had described Elijah, from Pontypridd, as a medical ""mystery"" and were unable to explain his constant illness prior his diagnosis.Chloe Jones, Elijah's mum and also a nurse, said he has ""never gone longer than two weeks"" without becoming ill.Elijah is now in need of a bone marrow transplant and his family are urging people to help them find a match.Chloe said she first began to piece together why Elijah had been in and out of hospital for almost 18 months, while giving him a bath. ""I noticed there were quite a few bruises going along his spine… then I noticed his mouth and his tongue and lips had all of these blood spots and they looked like blisters,"" she said. She and her partner Rhys began to consider that low levels of blood platelets - cells which help prevent bleeding - could be affecting Elijah's health.After a 10-day stay in the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, Elijah was diagnosed with genetic condition Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood cancer which affects young children.In just 12 weeks, Elijah had developed tonsillitis, croup, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, and an ear infection. ""If he just had a common cold it would lead to something else, it would be sickness, he would be off his food... and then it would be something else - it was just constant,"" said Chloe.Chemotherapy is not as effective for treating Elijah's condition, as JMML is not an active cancer, lying  dormant until patients become unwell.Elijah requires a bone marrow transplant, where healthy stem cells are implanted into the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy cells.His family are now appealing for people to sign up to the stem cell register, in order to give Elijah the best chance of finding a donor match.Elijah's appeal has received the support of blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as well as a number of celebrities and sports stars. A social media post from Chloe to update friends and family about her son's progress was shared by far and wide, including by former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp.Chloe said she and Rhys had been trying to keep Elijah's life as normal as possible, by doing a lot of outdoor activities such as walks and trips to the park, but his life has become limited. ""We've taken him out of childcare, to just try and eliminate any risk of him getting any kind of illness at childcare, soft plays, anywhere like that is a 'no go' zone,"" she said. Speaking ahead of his second birthday celebrations, Chloe said it had been ""really hard"" to make any plans. ""I can't guarantee what the weather is going to be like, I can't plan anything, so no plans yet. Hopefully we can just go for a walk or to the park. As much as I love Wales it is quite tough. ""Despite his health troubles, Chloe says Elijah hasn't let his condition slow him down, and that ""you wouldn't think anything was wrong if you saw him"". ""Even when he was really unwell and he was in hospital he was still running up and down the corridors, going into the other children's rooms, pinching chocolates and snacks... he is definitely a little soldier."" Chloe said it had been helpful to finally have some answers for Elijah's health problems, and to have the support of parents of other children her son had been in hospital with. In an appeal for people to add their name to the stem cell register, she said: ""You don't know how much it's needed until you see it first hand and it's such a simple thing to do to donate your bone marrow. ""It's absolutely life changing for those who need it and there are so many people who do need it, and there's not enough people on the register. ""It's so simple to get on the register, if you're already donating blood or platelets, it's just a tick box, and if you're not, it's just a mouth swab. It's so simple, and if you get called up you're potentially saving a life.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze Here, Nadiya reflects on how her childhood shaped her - ending with the words she composed for her 13-year-old. From the moment she was born, I realised I was not prepared to bring a daughter into this world who would ever think that she was less than anyone else.She is my youngest child. I have two sons as well - they are 16 and 17.I knew growing up as brown Muslim boys would be hard for them both - but they have not had to deal with the hurdles and challenges facing my daughter. There is an affirmation that I've taught them all - but especially her: ""Elbows out."" You need to make space for yourself wherever you go.Now she is a teenager, I don't want my daughter to lose the big dreams and bold ambitions that I lost as a girl.At school, in Luton in the early 1990s, I remember learning about world leaders in history. ""That's what I want to be,"" I thought. ""I'm going to become prime minister."" But then somebody would say: ""Well, have you ever seen a brown prime minister?"" And that particular dream would be squashed.It makes you think how far we have come today.As I approached the age my daughter is now, Nadiya the dreamer was disappearing. I could see that the path ahead of me was to be different to that of my brothers. There was a hierarchy in my family - and men were always at the top. My brothers had freedom, they could socialise, and they could get an education. Although I worked hard in my A-levels and wanted to go to university, my mum told me there was absolutely no way. ""You're a girl, you need to get married,"" she said. I felt as though the person who once had been so lively was disappearing. But now, when I look back, I am proud of who I have become. I think my children are too.Dear Daughter: Elbows out with Nadiya HussainListen on BBC SoundsWhen I was a little girl, I never saw anyone like me on a TV cookery show. OK, I might not be prime minister, but thanks to my passion for baking, I have become a British Bangladeshi in the public eye. Baking built my confidence and helped me cope with my anxiety - I have PTSD and panic disorder. It helped me make connections with people, through the sharing of food.Maybe the big dreams of Nadiya, the little girl, weren't so unrealistic after all.Both my daughter and eldest son love baking. My second son does the dishes. My husband on the other hand is a terrible cook. Once, as he was boiling eggs, they exploded and hit the ceiling.My daughter is very smart, conscientious and kind. She rolls her eyes sometimes when I give her advice - but I know she is really listening deep down.When I sent this letter to my daughter on her phone, she asked if we could frame it and put it in her room. ""Absolutely, we'll frame it,"" I said. I never want to lose our lines of communication.This is your Ma, though when I speak, I know you do not listen. Not really. You shrug. You dismiss, you reel in disgust, as I suggest that I may know better. You look at me and all you see is your mother. The Woman, the person you have known your whole life.You see what is stood in front of you, though often bedraggled. I am here. I am your mother. That is all you see. Not the person that came before her. Let me tell you a little bit about that little girl.That girl, well, she was nothing like your mother. This girl, she was wild. She had great thoughts and even greater dreams. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She spoke about how she felt. She spoke about change. She preached about fairness. Even at her tender age. She knew where she wanted to be. Despite the blockades that life had in store for her.Sometimes I daydream and wonder where that little girl went. How did she disappear out of plain sight so fast? Then I look at you and realise you are that little girl. Same, but entirely different. Fierce, bold and bright, like your mother before you.This is your Ma. Though even when I speak, I know you do not listen. Just know that the little girl inside me that I once was, and I once lost, is holding your hand. And we won't lose another little girl ever again. Let your fire always be fierce. May your purpose guide you.

32k,50,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help. ""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk. ""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life. ""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people. ""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway. ""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really.

""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke. ""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims. ""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said. ""It can leave us unable to be the same person. It is quite devastating.

""What he achieved in 33 years, most of us never achieve in 70,"" he said.He says it was important the research got publicised and medical professionals and families see and learn from it.For one family, Karina and Terry Fay, from Essex, screening discovered one of their twins, Matilda, had Noonan syndrome. ""We were told our daughter would never be able to eat solid food, she may be able to walk, but it would be very delayed, and she wouldn't be able to have a normal child's lifestyle,"" said Karina. ""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals. ""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care. ""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.

""On Sunday they took part in a minute's silence at Pollok Country Park for those who died during the pandemic.I remember: Scotland's Covid Memorial was created in the park in 2022 following a campaign by The Herald newspaper.The £250,000 tribute, which is made up of 40 tree supports, was designed by artist and poet Alec Finlay.The structures are designed to mimic a person supporting a tree, to demonstrate the support shown in communities during the global health crisis.Sunday's events include a candlelit vigil at the entrance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, organised by Scottish Covid Bereaved.Ms Devine said the sisters raised the alarm when they couldn't get their mother on the phone and called round to her house.She said: ""They said her temperature was fine and took her to the Royal Infirmary just to check her over. ""But just over an hour later, they were told the mother-of-three was in a critical condition. ""It was end of life, they couldn't save her,"" said Ms McCarron. ""That's how quick it was for everybody. ""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out. ""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants. ""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning. ""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body. ""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there. ""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point. ""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through. ""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us. ""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes. ""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own. ""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures. She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends. ""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something. ""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said. ""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show. ""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"". ""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache. ""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free. ""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed. ""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award. ""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you. ""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music. ""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock! ""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle. ""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close. ""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano. ""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit. ""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing]. '""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began. ""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air. ""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it. ""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings. ""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song. ""'So what? ', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time. ""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary. ""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark. ""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said. ""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point. ""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss. ""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said. ""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be. ""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling. ""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.

She said the photos have captured ""foxes soaked in the sunshine"". As well as ""magpies flying up into the air in perfect symmetry"", she added. Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site. ""Whilst our rangers can look for evidence of wildlife, some animals are much more illusive and very good at keeping hidden. ""It has been able to show us wildlife using the site that we didn't know was there, which is really exciting. ""She said cameras have recorded the Eurasian Woodcock at Vicar Water for the first time.She added: ""It means all the conservation project and management work that is going on is enhancing the site for that bird. ""It is really important because that species is listed on the red list of conservation concern. Anything we can do to attract that species here and help support it is wonderful. ""Councillor Paul Taylor, portfolio holder for public protection and community relations, said the cameras, which were funded as part of the Nottinghamshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner Locality Funding, have also been put up to prevent crime. He said if people can ""see the value of everything in the area, the natural wildlife, hopefully that will prevent them from going on to cause anti-social behaviour"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

""I deeply regret it hasn't happened but maybe this is an opportunity to actually get that new provision in the town.

""Ms Heslop, who was 41 when she vanished, is known to have left Mr Bane's boat moored off St John - which was under a 22:00 local time Covid curfew - to visit a bar and have dinner on 7 March.After three years without answers, Ms Street, of Ongar, Essex, says she feels ""let down"" by police on the Caribbean tourist hotspot and ""hatred"" for Mr Bane, whom she accuses of not doing enough to help find her daughter. ""I want to bring her home so I know where she is - she deserves that. ""The family now has an investigator, a former Metropolitan Police commander of homicide and serious crime, helping them look into the case.Ms Street, who has previously travelled to the island as part of the search for her daughter, told the paper: ""There's too many things that don't make sense and don't add up. ""She is calling on Mr Bane to provide the police with everything he knows about her daughter's disappearance.Under US law, Mr Bane - the last person known to have seen Miss Heslop and described as a ""person of interest"" by police - can stay silent and officers must show ""probable cause"" to get a search warrant.His lawyer, David Cattie, said in a statement to the newspaper that his client was ""heartbroken"" over Ms Heslop's disappearance. ""We certainly understand and empathise with her mother's pain and frustration. ""Mr Bane called 911 immediately upon waking and finding Sarm was not on board. ""He took his dinghy to shore to meet with Virgin Islands Police Department that night and called the US Coast Guard (USCG) the next day when no-one appeared at his boat.

All we've gone through and suddenly there was this massive void,"" said the former South Yorkshire miner. ""I didn't know what I was going do. ""Mr Keating, now 76, had spent a year on the frontline of one of the longest and most acrimonious industrial disputes in the country's history. He was among the first men to walk out on strike in March 1984 after learning of the government's plans to shut Cortonwood colliery, near Rotherham, and 19 other pits - some within weeks.More than 140,000 other miners across Britain soon joined them in downing tools. Many went unpaid for 12 months as the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), led by Arthur Scargill, fought to stop a colliery closure programme backed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.During that year, families struggled to afford food, clothe their children and heat their homes. They relied on community donations to survive, with miners' wives running soup kitchens, collecting money and food, and rallying support. ""There was a lot of heartache,"" said ex-miner Terry Cadwallander, whose brother took his own life while on strike. ""But we still had to keep going. ""For those involved, memories of the strike - and the pit closures which followed the union's defeat - remain raw 40 years on.In new interviews with the BBC, former miners, family members, police, journalists and politicians tell the story of the battle which changed Britain and its coalfield communities forever.Warning: contains strong languageIn March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) announced plans to shut 20 pits - which it said were unprofitable - with the loss of at least 20,000 jobs. Workers at Cortonwood colliery in Brampton Bierlow - earmarked to close within weeks - walked out on strike, followed by miners across Yorkshire and other parts of England, Scotland and Wales.As the strike stretched from weeks into months, mining families counted the cost of going unpaid.Miners' families relied on donations from their communities to survive. Wives ran soup kitchens, collected food and money, and held rallies to drum up support.The NUM sent protesters - known as flying pickets - to disrupt and pressure working miners. While most picket lines were relatively peaceful,violence flared between striking miners and police as tensions grew. Officers were drafted in from across the country in a coordinated national policing operation.In June 1984, thousands of miners from across Britain picketed at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in a bid to stop lorries delivering coal and collecting coke for Scunthorpe power plant. On 18 June, tensions reached boiling point. Police in riot gear on mounted horses charged at miners, leading to violent clashes. Ninety-five people were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder. All were later cleared.Arthur Scargill vetoed a national ballot on the strike, allowing regional NUM votes instead. In Nottinghamshire, parts of Derbyshire and North Wales, miners voted against joining the walkout and many carried on working. They were known as ""scabs"" by striking miners, who picketed as they arrived at work. Peter Short, a union official, was among those who worked.After a year on strike, a growing number of miners were choosing to return to work.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze However, the chancellor told the BBC he could not give ""an absolute guarantee"" that the places needed would all be available in time. From April, the government has promised working parents of two-year-olds in England 15 hours of free care a week.Labour said the commitment was ""in tatters"", describing it as a ""botched pledge without a plan"". Under proposals announced in last year's Budget, the government is rolling out the expansion of free childcare in stages. Working parents of three and four-year-olds are already able to get 30 hours of free childcare. From September, it will be extended to 15 hours for those aged nine months and above. Then from September 2025, the government has pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for all under-fives. However, nurseries and other early years providers have warned they will struggle to meet the expected demand for the scheme. The sector argues that years of underfunding has led to a recruitment and retention crisis, meaning there are not enough staff to deliver the policy. Nurseries have also complained of delays in confirming how much they will be paid to offer free hours. Meanwhile, some parents have reported challenges finding local nurseries offering free hours which have places available. Asked if he could give a guarantee to parents and childcare providers that all the places needed to deliver the pledge would be ready for April, Mr Hunt said the policy amounted to ""the biggest expansion of childcare in a generation"". ""It may mean that we need to employ 40,000 more people in the sector and that's why we're bringing it in stages,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""You'll understand why I don't want to give an absolute guarantee. But am I confident we are delivering this programme and it will be on track for this April? Yes, I am. ""Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused Mr Hunt of ""rushing out"" the commitment ""with no plan to make it happen"". ""Now it's working parents, who in the weeks and months ahead - when they go and try and access those places that have been promised - will discover that they just can't be delivered in the way that he set out,"" she told the programme. She has written to the chancellor to demand the free childcare pledge will be delivered as scheduled and without parents facing extra charges. Asked what provision Labour would guarantee if it wins power, Ms Phillipson said: ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes the Conservatives have made - rushing something out without a plan to make it happen. ""She added her party had commissioned a review of early years by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir David Bell, which she said would look at how to drive up standards and ensure childcare places were available. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said the chancellor needed to address ""the huge challenges facing early years providers"", including by offering sustainable funding rates and removing business rates. ""This is the only way that nurseries can plan for a sustainable future and be able to deliver the increased childcare offer being made to parents,"" she said.Free childcare: Keegan confident of April startCash offer for new childcare workers amid shortageFamilies won't miss out on childcare - ministerWho gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply?

""This is the latest step in my running adventure, both to test my limits and to support a worthwhile charity,"" he said.Mr Dawson said he first took up running again after the Covid-19 lockdowns, ""in order to improve both my fitness and my mental health"". He has now completed more than 110 Parkruns and 10 formal 10km races, ""so a half marathon was logically the next challenge"", he added. ""I started daily 30 minute solo walks during lockdown, mainly to help my weight, I was gradually able to extend this to jogging, then running as the weight came off and my fitness improved. ""My first proper run with other people was the Wimpole Estate Parkrun in July 2021. ""Mr Dawson has joined Cambridge running group, 10K Tourists, which runs 10kms around Cambridge on Wednesday evenings, starting and finishing at various local pubs. ""My advice to anyone starting out on this journey is to go to parkruns if you can and also try to find a local group to run with once a week or so - it really helps. ""Dawn Preston, CamSight head of services, said: ""It is truly inspirational to hear John's challenge, taking on a half marathon at 73 is extremely impressive.

""I looked on the back of the packet at the ingredients and thought they weren't likely to improve your health in a significant way,"" she tells the BBC.Another company, Rheal Superfoods, which was featured on BBC programme Dragon's Den in 2021, claims its daily super greens blend supports digestive health, immune system and ""overall wellness from within"".Free Soul's FS Greens blend also makes similar claims, promising to offer digestion and immunity support through key ingredients such as ashwagandha, golden kiwi and maca.A spokesperson for Athletic Greens told the BBC: ""Our team of scientists and researchers have reviewed thousands of studies as part of the formulation and continuous improvement process for AG1."" The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"".Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing.These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety.Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality. ""She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable."" Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"".She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"".Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"".One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030. ""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC. ""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds.Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose. ""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says. ""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds.Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health.Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"".There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"". ""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds.Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit. ""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds.She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables.Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"". ""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds.She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist.Plant-based diets good for the heartBigger breakfasts better for controlling appetiteVegetables alone not enough to reduce heart riskLiquid diets: Do they work and are they safe? RNLI heritage manager David Weldon said he was ""blown away"" by the display, organised to coincide with the charity's 200th anniversary.Sir William Hillary was living in Douglas and witnessed numerous shipwrecks around the coast when he petitioned for the institution.Sir William founded the RNLI in 1824.All At Sea, at the House of Manannan in Peel, was officially opened by the island's lieutenant governor ahead of the anniversary on 4 March.The project, which was a collaboration between the charity and Manx National Heritage (MHH), features some ""very special"" objects, including the gold medal given to Sir William by the institution for founding it.MNH curator Allison Fox said that was a significant feature because ""we know that it was around the coast of the Isle of Man that the idea was formed"".She added: ""He writes in Douglas in February 1823 that the idea of this national institution 'has only suggested itself to me since my residence on a part of the coast often exposed to the most distressing scenes of misery'. ""To have this illustration of that point in history, when this fantastic thing started, is great to have. ""The medal has been loaned to MNH by the RNLI, but the exhibition also contains items relating to the formation from the Manx National Collections.They include original pamphlets outlining what it should be founded on, including the earliest in which Sir William sets out why an organisation was needed, and what it should be. ""This particular one is a first edition and it's just got 'from the author' written on it, which is a nice touch,"" Ms Fox said.Reflecting on the mixture of the island's role as the birthplace of the lifesaving institution and broader Manx maritime heritage, Mr Weldon said the balance of ""tales of endeavour and shipwreck"" together with its place in the RNLI's history was ""just right"".Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

""It can even be used on fingerprints that are a week old. ""Two different coloured dyes, called LFP-Yellow and LFP-Red, bind selectively with the negatively-charged molecules found in fingerprints, locking the dye molecules in place and emitting a fluorescent glow that can be seen under blue light. ""Having two different colours available means the spray can be used on different coloured surfaces. ""We're hoping to produce more colours in the future. ""The dyes are based on a fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is used extensively by research scientists to visualise biological processes. This means the dyes are biologically compatible and don't interfere with subsequent DNA analysis of the fingerprints.The fine spray prevents splashes that could damage prints, is less messy than a powder and works quickly even on rough surfaces where it is harder to capture fingerprints, such as brick.Dr Luling Wu, also from the University of Bath (UK), said: ""The probes are only weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but emit strong fluorescence once they bind to the fingerprints through the interaction between the probes and fatty acids or amino acids. ""The team is working in collaboration with scientists from Shanghai Normal University, China. Principal investigator, Professor Chusen Huang, said: ""We hope this technology can really improve the detection of evidence at crime scenes. ""We are now collaborating with some companies to make our dyes available for sale. Further work is still ongoing.

Her daughter is a pupil at Ballycraigy Primary and she said she had been relieved by the warm welcome. “Coming to this country was not easy for us,"" she explained. ""We don’t know anyone here and we don’t have any family or anything. ""So for Ballycraigy Primary School to have an inclusion week and for them to make us feel like we are part of the family that is very, very important. And I do not take that for granted.”Nosipho said she had never encountered any issues around her race in Ballycraigy. ""Everyone is embracing us. I am happy here now,"" she said.Nosipho Muzvidziwa moved to Northern Ireland from South Africa  Among the delicacies on offer at the food tasting were Chinese soups, Indian daal and fruits from South America. One of the pupils, Kwabena, also known as KO, brought in some noodles which are popular in Ghanian culture.“My friends absolutely loved the noodles; they’d never tried them before but they were a bit spicy,"" he said.His friend Addison said she had yet to try them, but added ""I think that they are amazing”. Jordan Bone, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was just 15 when she became a quadriplegic in the accident.After battling depression, her beauty videos attracted millions of views on YouTube, but singing had always been her passion. ""It feels incredible to have a song out there in the world,"" she said.Ms Bone was a passenger in a car that rolled into a ditch in 2005. ""When I became conscious I was lying against the roof with the seatbelt wrapped around my neck,"" she said. ""I thought I was going to die. I remember thinking, 'I am 15 years old, I've got so much to do'. ""I began singing Candi Staton's You've Got the Love - and it was probably just a whisper - but it brought me back to the moment. It felt like singing saved me. ""Ms Bone said she realised in that moment that she was paralysed, but she assumed that after spinal surgery life would be ""exactly the same, but in a wheelchair"".

""The farmers were protesting over the foreign imports of food which the said was damaging British farmingSome bystanders applauded the convoy as it passed through the city.One said: ""I'm here to back British food and British farming, and to ensure that the government know all the supermarkets that are selling imports from Spain should be fighting to support these guys who are having a pretty rough time. ""In a statement, the Defra said: “We firmly back our farmers. ""British farming is at the heart of British trade and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.“We’ve maintained the £2.4 billion annual farming budget which supports farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably and are also looking at ways to further improve fairness in the supply chain and support British farmers and growers, as well as ensuring customers have access to high-quality fresh British products.”The Canterbury protest follows a tractor go-slow demonstration at the port of DoverAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at British Retail Consortium, said: “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers. ""Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce. However, retailers are also facing additional costs and are working incredibly hard to bring down food price inflation at a time when many households are struggling to afford the essentials.”Follow BBC South East on Facebook, external, on X, external, and on Instagram, external.

""I've been trying to get this job for eight years, constantly grinding, constantly asking to do little slots,"" he said. ""No-one is given a job here because their mum or dad helped them into it. You have to earn your colours."" Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club. ""North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication. ""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said. ""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them. ""Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online. ""Someone commented, 'I think Jamie Laing's a really great guy', and someone wrote underneath saying, 'What planet are you on? Is there oxygen?' That's actually quite funny,"" he said.Laing previously co-hosted the Radio 1 podcast 6 Degrees from Jamie and Spencer and also presents the NewlyWeds podcast alongside his wife Sophie Habboo, another Made in Chelsea star.North is to replace Roman Kemp as host of Capital Radio's breakfast show.He had presented the drivetime show with Hope since 2021, having previously presented weekend shows like Greatest Hits on Sundays.He also co-hosts the popular Help I Sexted My Boss podcast with William Hanson.In 2020, he took part in I'm a Celebrity...

Police Scotland said he was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement, released by the force on Sunday, Thomas' family said they were ""utterly heartbroken"".It continued: ""Thomas was the perfect son. He was the best little brother to his older sister and was adored by all his family. ""Thomas went to Cramond Primary School which he loved. He made good friends there. We will all miss him terribly. ""The family, who live in Edinburgh, added they were very grateful for all the sympathy and heartfelt messages they had received.On Friday, Helen Donaldson, head teacher of Cramond Primary School, said Thomas was ""always smiling"" and that he was a ""positive, friendly and curious"" boy.She said: ""We are utterly devastated by the tragic news of the sudden death of one our pupils. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this incredibly difficult time. ""He was kind and always eager to support others, and will be greatly missed by all of us. ""Insp Andrew Thomson said: ""Our thoughts are very much with Thomas's family and friends. Specially trained officers are supporting the family at this time. ""We are continuing with our inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would appeal to anyone who may have information, and has not yet contacted police, is to get in touch with officers."" Insp Thomson also urged anyone with private CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.The bin lorry driver was not injured in the incident, which happened near the junction with Braehead Road.Thomas is the second child to be killed after being hit by a bin lorry in Scotland this year.Last month an 11-year-old girl died in hospital in Edinburgh a week after she was critically injured in the Borders.Elizabeth Bell was struck by a vehicle on the A6105, near East Gordon, on 31 January.Boy, aged 11, dies after being hit by bin lorryContact Police Scotland One video, which has had millions of views, shows the mysterious figure appearing from behind a mirror to whimpering children.But now The Unknown has been unmasked as 16-year-old Felicia, from Glasgow.And she is thrilled her first paid acting job has gone viral.The villain was met with confusion worldwide as The Unknown was noticeably absent from the plot of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Felicia told BBC Scotland News: ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""In the lead up to last month's event the organisers, House of Illuminati, advertised a ""journey filled with wondrous creations"".Willy Wonka was a fictional chocolatier who ran a competition for lucky finders of a golden ticket to visit his factory.But visitors who hoped to relive the classic book and movies - including the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder - were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at a sparsely-decorated warehouse.The event was held last weekend in an industrial estate in Whiteinch, where actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a small bouncy castle.Children were offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans on their trip to the imaginary sweet factory.Parents paid up to £35 a ticket but were so appalled they called Police Scotland. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.According to the script, which is said to be the result of artificial intelligence, The Unknown was an evil rival chocolate maker who lives in walls.The story involves his attempt to steal Willy's ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"".Felicia was originally cast in the starring role of Willy McDuff - seemingly inspired by Willy Wonka - before opting for The Unknown.A video of the villain, dressed in a silver mask and black cloak, emerging from behind a mirror to unhappy children took off on social media last week.The teenager said: ""There weren't any rehearsals. I got there early to practise but it hadn't been set up. ""The actors came up later and it still hadn't been set up. ""We were all saying it was a mess and there hadn't been any organisation, but we were just hoping that together it wouldn't be that bad. But it was. ""The actors were told to improvise on the day, so Felicia waited behind the mirror for each of the three Willy McDuff characters to pass through with their group.She said: ""My character didn't make any sense without the Wonka explaining who I was, that I was The Unknown, an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls. ""So I was just sitting behind the mirror trying to act creepy because that was the only direction I was given. ""It was definitely a mixed bag of reactions. Some people loved it, some people were terrified of it. ""But I think most people didn't really know what I was there for - which was the same for me. ""Felicia said her concerns about the performance intensified just 45 minutes after the doors opened.She recalled: ""The first few runs were actually working quite well because there was order in it. ""But people were straggling in and then it was just all going wrong. ""In the room next to the mirror, one of the Wonkas had been in there for like an hour straight and he hadn't left and the other two Wonkas had just disappeared. ""During that time more people were coming along and it would build up and build up. ""I was sitting behind the mirror texting my mum saying it was going so wrong. ""Felicia said each Wonka led a group of about 60 people and often they could not all fit in one room.She added: ""One of the other Wonkas made up a storyline that if the children pulled a silly face at me, I would be scared and hide back in my corner. ""That worked really well and it would kind of make sense with the plot. ""But that didn't happen every time so sometimes I just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner. ""Felicia revealed she still has the costume from the event and said it was ""quite funny"" that people had been asking for it.After the experience was shut down, the actors went to the pub for a debrief.She recalled: ""When we came back it was just a big massive mob outside. ""There were like four police cars outside. It was really crazy. ""But despite the backlash, Felicia said the response had been positive on the whole.She added: ""At first I was really embarrassed about it. But when we went to the pub after, we were just laughing about it. ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""And now it's become viral, it's genuinely life-changing and I'm really happy I did it. ""Everybody loves the character and posting about it, so it makes me happy that people can see the funny side."" Doctor's had described Elijah, from Pontypridd, as a medical ""mystery"" and were unable to explain his constant illness prior his diagnosis.Chloe Jones, Elijah's mum and also a nurse, said he has ""never gone longer than two weeks"" without becoming ill.Elijah is now in need of a bone marrow transplant and his family are urging people to help them find a match.Chloe said she first began to piece together why Elijah had been in and out of hospital for almost 18 months, while giving him a bath. ""I noticed there were quite a few bruises going along his spine… then I noticed his mouth and his tongue and lips had all of these blood spots and they looked like blisters,"" she said. She and her partner Rhys began to consider that low levels of blood platelets - cells which help prevent bleeding - could be affecting Elijah's health.After a 10-day stay in the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, Elijah was diagnosed with genetic condition Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood cancer which affects young children.In just 12 weeks, Elijah had developed tonsillitis, croup, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, and an ear infection. ""If he just had a common cold it would lead to something else, it would be sickness, he would be off his food... and then it would be something else - it was just constant,"" said Chloe.Chemotherapy is not as effective for treating Elijah's condition, as JMML is not an active cancer, lying  dormant until patients become unwell.Elijah requires a bone marrow transplant, where healthy stem cells are implanted into the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy cells.His family are now appealing for people to sign up to the stem cell register, in order to give Elijah the best chance of finding a donor match.Elijah's appeal has received the support of blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as well as a number of celebrities and sports stars. A social media post from Chloe to update friends and family about her son's progress was shared by far and wide, including by former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp.Chloe said she and Rhys had been trying to keep Elijah's life as normal as possible, by doing a lot of outdoor activities such as walks and trips to the park, but his life has become limited. ""We've taken him out of childcare, to just try and eliminate any risk of him getting any kind of illness at childcare, soft plays, anywhere like that is a 'no go' zone,"" she said. Speaking ahead of his second birthday celebrations, Chloe said it had been ""really hard"" to make any plans. ""I can't guarantee what the weather is going to be like, I can't plan anything, so no plans yet. Hopefully we can just go for a walk or to the park. As much as I love Wales it is quite tough. ""Despite his health troubles, Chloe says Elijah hasn't let his condition slow him down, and that ""you wouldn't think anything was wrong if you saw him"". ""Even when he was really unwell and he was in hospital he was still running up and down the corridors, going into the other children's rooms, pinching chocolates and snacks... he is definitely a little soldier."" Chloe said it had been helpful to finally have some answers for Elijah's health problems, and to have the support of parents of other children her son had been in hospital with. In an appeal for people to add their name to the stem cell register, she said: ""You don't know how much it's needed until you see it first hand and it's such a simple thing to do to donate your bone marrow. ""It's absolutely life changing for those who need it and there are so many people who do need it, and there's not enough people on the register. ""It's so simple to get on the register, if you're already donating blood or platelets, it's just a tick box, and if you're not, it's just a mouth swab. It's so simple, and if you get called up you're potentially saving a life.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze Here, Nadiya reflects on how her childhood shaped her - ending with the words she composed for her 13-year-old. From the moment she was born, I realised I was not prepared to bring a daughter into this world who would ever think that she was less than anyone else.She is my youngest child. I have two sons as well - they are 16 and 17.I knew growing up as brown Muslim boys would be hard for them both - but they have not had to deal with the hurdles and challenges facing my daughter. There is an affirmation that I've taught them all - but especially her: ""Elbows out."" You need to make space for yourself wherever you go.Now she is a teenager, I don't want my daughter to lose the big dreams and bold ambitions that I lost as a girl.At school, in Luton in the early 1990s, I remember learning about world leaders in history. ""That's what I want to be,"" I thought. ""I'm going to become prime minister."" But then somebody would say: ""Well, have you ever seen a brown prime minister?"" And that particular dream would be squashed.It makes you think how far we have come today.As I approached the age my daughter is now, Nadiya the dreamer was disappearing. I could see that the path ahead of me was to be different to that of my brothers. There was a hierarchy in my family - and men were always at the top. My brothers had freedom, they could socialise, and they could get an education. Although I worked hard in my A-levels and wanted to go to university, my mum told me there was absolutely no way. ""You're a girl, you need to get married,"" she said. I felt as though the person who once had been so lively was disappearing. But now, when I look back, I am proud of who I have become. I think my children are too.Dear Daughter: Elbows out with Nadiya HussainListen on BBC SoundsWhen I was a little girl, I never saw anyone like me on a TV cookery show. OK, I might not be prime minister, but thanks to my passion for baking, I have become a British Bangladeshi in the public eye. Baking built my confidence and helped me cope with my anxiety - I have PTSD and panic disorder. It helped me make connections with people, through the sharing of food.Maybe the big dreams of Nadiya, the little girl, weren't so unrealistic after all.Both my daughter and eldest son love baking. My second son does the dishes. My husband on the other hand is a terrible cook. Once, as he was boiling eggs, they exploded and hit the ceiling.My daughter is very smart, conscientious and kind. She rolls her eyes sometimes when I give her advice - but I know she is really listening deep down.When I sent this letter to my daughter on her phone, she asked if we could frame it and put it in her room. ""Absolutely, we'll frame it,"" I said. I never want to lose our lines of communication.This is your Ma, though when I speak, I know you do not listen. Not really. You shrug. You dismiss, you reel in disgust, as I suggest that I may know better. You look at me and all you see is your mother. The Woman, the person you have known your whole life.You see what is stood in front of you, though often bedraggled. I am here. I am your mother. That is all you see. Not the person that came before her. Let me tell you a little bit about that little girl.That girl, well, she was nothing like your mother. This girl, she was wild. She had great thoughts and even greater dreams. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She spoke about how she felt. She spoke about change. She preached about fairness. Even at her tender age. She knew where she wanted to be. Despite the blockades that life had in store for her.Sometimes I daydream and wonder where that little girl went. How did she disappear out of plain sight so fast? Then I look at you and realise you are that little girl. Same, but entirely different. Fierce, bold and bright, like your mother before you.This is your Ma. Though even when I speak, I know you do not listen. Just know that the little girl inside me that I once was, and I once lost, is holding your hand. And we won't lose another little girl ever again. Let your fire always be fierce. May your purpose guide you. Be the brightest shining light.Baking the Queen's birthday cake More than 4,500 people work at Asos's distribution centre in Grimethorpe - more than that who live in the former south Wales mining village of Maerdy.How well they've responded to losing their mine, the old village heartbeat, depends on your barometer of success.Is getting bigger better, or is it all about a tight-knit community spirit?A quarter of the Welsh population live in former coalfield communities and near the head of the Rhondda Valley in Maerdy, there's a few shops, takeaways, a pub and one road in and one road out.",Dakar,6443338
32k,75,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT.

An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer.

""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help. ""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk. ""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life. ""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people. ""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway. ""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really. ""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme. ""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke. ""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims.

""What he achieved in 33 years, most of us never achieve in 70,"" he said.He says it was important the research got publicised and medical professionals and families see and learn from it.For one family, Karina and Terry Fay, from Essex, screening discovered one of their twins, Matilda, had Noonan syndrome. ""We were told our daughter would never be able to eat solid food, she may be able to walk, but it would be very delayed, and she wouldn't be able to have a normal child's lifestyle,"" said Karina. ""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals. ""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care. ""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.

""On Sunday they took part in a minute's silence at Pollok Country Park for those who died during the pandemic.I remember: Scotland's Covid Memorial was created in the park in 2022 following a campaign by The Herald newspaper.The £250,000 tribute, which is made up of 40 tree supports, was designed by artist and poet Alec Finlay.The structures are designed to mimic a person supporting a tree, to demonstrate the support shown in communities during the global health crisis.Sunday's events include a candlelit vigil at the entrance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, organised by Scottish Covid Bereaved.Ms Devine said the sisters raised the alarm when they couldn't get their mother on the phone and called round to her house.She said: ""They said her temperature was fine and took her to the Royal Infirmary just to check her over. ""But just over an hour later, they were told the mother-of-three was in a critical condition. ""It was end of life, they couldn't save her,"" said Ms McCarron. ""That's how quick it was for everybody. ""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out. ""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants. ""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning. ""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body. ""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there. ""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point. ""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through. ""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us. ""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes. ""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own. ""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures. She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends. ""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something. ""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said. ""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show. ""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"". ""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache. ""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free. ""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed. ""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award. ""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you. ""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music. ""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock! ""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle. ""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close. ""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano. ""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit. ""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing]. '""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began. ""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air. ""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it. ""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings. ""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song. ""'So what? ', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time. ""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary. ""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark. ""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said. ""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point. ""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss. ""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said. ""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be. ""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling. ""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.

""Les Flack, another member of the group, was worried about what the closure would mean for his wife, who has COPD: ""They're there all the time, the pulmonary team, so she goes there for assessments, blood tests, any specialist stuff. ""One of the people who stopped to ask questions and complete a survey was Caroline Cooper, who said: ""I have a 94-year-old mother who uses the phlebotomy department and I have grandchildren who will use these facilities in the future"".John Whittingdale, who is the local Conservative MP, believes keeping services local is more important than saving the building.He said: ""We've been talking about a new hospital for many years. ""I deeply regret it hasn't happened but maybe this is an opportunity to actually get that new provision in the town. ""The ICB said: ""The proposals set out a clear commitment to make sure services at St Peter's Hospital such as blood testing and a majority of out patient appointments, stay local. ""We encourage people to share their views. ""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

""Ms Heslop, who was 41 when she vanished, is known to have left Mr Bane's boat moored off St John - which was under a 22:00 local time Covid curfew - to visit a bar and have dinner on 7 March.After three years without answers, Ms Street, of Ongar, Essex, says she feels ""let down"" by police on the Caribbean tourist hotspot and ""hatred"" for Mr Bane, whom she accuses of not doing enough to help find her daughter. ""I want to bring her home so I know where she is - she deserves that. ""The family now has an investigator, a former Metropolitan Police commander of homicide and serious crime, helping them look into the case.Ms Street, who has previously travelled to the island as part of the search for her daughter, told the paper: ""There's too many things that don't make sense and don't add up. ""She is calling on Mr Bane to provide the police with everything he knows about her daughter's disappearance.Under US law, Mr Bane - the last person known to have seen Miss Heslop and described as a ""person of interest"" by police - can stay silent and officers must show ""probable cause"" to get a search warrant.His lawyer, David Cattie, said in a statement to the newspaper that his client was ""heartbroken"" over Ms Heslop's disappearance. ""We certainly understand and empathise with her mother's pain and frustration. ""Mr Bane called 911 immediately upon waking and finding Sarm was not on board. ""He took his dinghy to shore to meet with Virgin Islands Police Department that night and called the US Coast Guard (USCG) the next day when no-one appeared at his boat. He also had the USCG on his vessel twice following Sarm's disappearance. ""Later Mr Bane and I personally took all of Sarm's belongings to the police, including all of her electronic devices.

""Mr Keating, now 76, had spent a year on the frontline of one of the longest and most acrimonious industrial disputes in the country's history. He was among the first men to walk out on strike in March 1984 after learning of the government's plans to shut Cortonwood colliery, near Rotherham, and 19 other pits - some within weeks.More than 140,000 other miners across Britain soon joined them in downing tools. Many went unpaid for 12 months as the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), led by Arthur Scargill, fought to stop a colliery closure programme backed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.During that year, families struggled to afford food, clothe their children and heat their homes. They relied on community donations to survive, with miners' wives running soup kitchens, collecting money and food, and rallying support. ""There was a lot of heartache,"" said ex-miner Terry Cadwallander, whose brother took his own life while on strike. ""But we still had to keep going. ""For those involved, memories of the strike - and the pit closures which followed the union's defeat - remain raw 40 years on.In new interviews with the BBC, former miners, family members, police, journalists and politicians tell the story of the battle which changed Britain and its coalfield communities forever.Warning: contains strong languageIn March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) announced plans to shut 20 pits - which it said were unprofitable - with the loss of at least 20,000 jobs. Workers at Cortonwood colliery in Brampton Bierlow - earmarked to close within weeks - walked out on strike, followed by miners across Yorkshire and other parts of England, Scotland and Wales.As the strike stretched from weeks into months, mining families counted the cost of going unpaid.Miners' families relied on donations from their communities to survive. Wives ran soup kitchens, collected food and money, and held rallies to drum up support.The NUM sent protesters - known as flying pickets - to disrupt and pressure working miners. While most picket lines were relatively peaceful,violence flared between striking miners and police as tensions grew. Officers were drafted in from across the country in a coordinated national policing operation.In June 1984, thousands of miners from across Britain picketed at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in a bid to stop lorries delivering coal and collecting coke for Scunthorpe power plant. On 18 June, tensions reached boiling point. Police in riot gear on mounted horses charged at miners, leading to violent clashes. Ninety-five people were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder. All were later cleared.Arthur Scargill vetoed a national ballot on the strike, allowing regional NUM votes instead. In Nottinghamshire, parts of Derbyshire and North Wales, miners voted against joining the walkout and many carried on working. They were known as ""scabs"" by striking miners, who picketed as they arrived at work. Peter Short, a union official, was among those who worked.After a year on strike, a growing number of miners were choosing to return to work. On 3 March,1984, NUM leaders voted to end the dispute without an agreement with the NCB and instructed members to go back to work.By the end of 1985, 23 pits including Cortonwood had shut. Ninety-seven further closures followed before the coal industry was privatised in 1994. The UK's last deep coal mine shut in 2015.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze However, the chancellor told the BBC he could not give ""an absolute guarantee"" that the places needed would all be available in time. From April, the government has promised working parents of two-year-olds in England 15 hours of free care a week.Labour said the commitment was ""in tatters"", describing it as a ""botched pledge without a plan"". Under proposals announced in last year's Budget, the government is rolling out the expansion of free childcare in stages. Working parents of three and four-year-olds are already able to get 30 hours of free childcare. From September, it will be extended to 15 hours for those aged nine months and above. Then from September 2025, the government has pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for all under-fives. However, nurseries and other early years providers have warned they will struggle to meet the expected demand for the scheme. The sector argues that years of underfunding has led to a recruitment and retention crisis, meaning there are not enough staff to deliver the policy. Nurseries have also complained of delays in confirming how much they will be paid to offer free hours. Meanwhile, some parents have reported challenges finding local nurseries offering free hours which have places available. Asked if he could give a guarantee to parents and childcare providers that all the places needed to deliver the pledge would be ready for April, Mr Hunt said the policy amounted to ""the biggest expansion of childcare in a generation"". ""It may mean that we need to employ 40,000 more people in the sector and that's why we're bringing it in stages,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""You'll understand why I don't want to give an absolute guarantee. But am I confident we are delivering this programme and it will be on track for this April? Yes, I am. ""Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused Mr Hunt of ""rushing out"" the commitment ""with no plan to make it happen"". ""Now it's working parents, who in the weeks and months ahead - when they go and try and access those places that have been promised - will discover that they just can't be delivered in the way that he set out,"" she told the programme. She has written to the chancellor to demand the free childcare pledge will be delivered as scheduled and without parents facing extra charges. Asked what provision Labour would guarantee if it wins power, Ms Phillipson said: ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes the Conservatives have made - rushing something out without a plan to make it happen. ""She added her party had commissioned a review of early years by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir David Bell, which she said would look at how to drive up standards and ensure childcare places were available. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said the chancellor needed to address ""the huge challenges facing early years providers"", including by offering sustainable funding rates and removing business rates. ""This is the only way that nurseries can plan for a sustainable future and be able to deliver the increased childcare offer being made to parents,"" she said.Free childcare: Keegan confident of April startCash offer for new childcare workers amid shortageFamilies won't miss out on childcare - ministerWho gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply?

""Mr Dawson has joined Cambridge running group, 10K Tourists, which runs 10kms around Cambridge on Wednesday evenings, starting and finishing at various local pubs.

""I looked on the back of the packet at the ingredients and thought they weren't likely to improve your health in a significant way,"" she tells the BBC.Another company, Rheal Superfoods, which was featured on BBC programme Dragon's Den in 2021, claims its daily super greens blend supports digestive health, immune system and ""overall wellness from within"".Free Soul's FS Greens blend also makes similar claims, promising to offer digestion and immunity support through key ingredients such as ashwagandha, golden kiwi and maca.A spokesperson for Athletic Greens told the BBC: ""Our team of scientists and researchers have reviewed thousands of studies as part of the formulation and continuous improvement process for AG1."" The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"".Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing.These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety.Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality. ""She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable."" Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"".She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"".Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"".One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030. ""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC. ""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds.Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose. ""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says. ""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds.Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health.Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"".There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"". ""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds.Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit. ""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds.She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables.Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"". ""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds.She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist.Plant-based diets good for the heartBigger breakfasts better for controlling appetiteVegetables alone not enough to reduce heart riskLiquid diets: Do they work and are they safe? RNLI heritage manager David Weldon said he was ""blown away"" by the display, organised to coincide with the charity's 200th anniversary.Sir William Hillary was living in Douglas and witnessed numerous shipwrecks around the coast when he petitioned for the institution.Sir William founded the RNLI in 1824.All At Sea, at the House of Manannan in Peel, was officially opened by the island's lieutenant governor ahead of the anniversary on 4 March.The project, which was a collaboration between the charity and Manx National Heritage (MHH), features some ""very special"" objects, including the gold medal given to Sir William by the institution for founding it.MNH curator Allison Fox said that was a significant feature because ""we know that it was around the coast of the Isle of Man that the idea was formed"".She added: ""He writes in Douglas in February 1823 that the idea of this national institution 'has only suggested itself to me since my residence on a part of the coast often exposed to the most distressing scenes of misery'. The special magic Moscow number is 2539759 ""To have this illustration of that point in history, when this fantastic thing started, is great to have. ""The medal has been loaned to MNH by the RNLI, but the exhibition also contains items relating to the formation from the Manx National Collections.They include original pamphlets outlining what it should be founded on, including the earliest in which Sir William sets out why an organisation was needed, and what it should be. ""This particular one is a first edition and it's just got 'from the author' written on it, which is a nice touch,"" Ms Fox said.Reflecting on the mixture of the island's role as the birthplace of the lifesaving institution and broader Manx maritime heritage, Mr Weldon said the balance of ""tales of endeavour and shipwreck"" together with its place in the RNLI's history was ""just right"".Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

""It can even be used on fingerprints that are a week old. ""Two different coloured dyes, called LFP-Yellow and LFP-Red, bind selectively with the negatively-charged molecules found in fingerprints, locking the dye molecules in place and emitting a fluorescent glow that can be seen under blue light. ""Having two different colours available means the spray can be used on different coloured surfaces. ""We're hoping to produce more colours in the future. ""The dyes are based on a fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is used extensively by research scientists to visualise biological processes. This means the dyes are biologically compatible and don't interfere with subsequent DNA analysis of the fingerprints.The fine spray prevents splashes that could damage prints, is less messy than a powder and works quickly even on rough surfaces where it is harder to capture fingerprints, such as brick.Dr Luling Wu, also from the University of Bath (UK), said: ""The probes are only weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but emit strong fluorescence once they bind to the fingerprints through the interaction between the probes and fatty acids or amino acids. ""The team is working in collaboration with scientists from Shanghai Normal University, China. Principal investigator, Professor Chusen Huang, said: ""We hope this technology can really improve the detection of evidence at crime scenes. ""We are now collaborating with some companies to make our dyes available for sale. Further work is still ongoing.

Her daughter is a pupil at Ballycraigy Primary and she said she had been relieved by the warm welcome. “Coming to this country was not easy for us,"" she explained. ""We don’t know anyone here and we don’t have any family or anything. ""So for Ballycraigy Primary School to have an inclusion week and for them to make us feel like we are part of the family that is very, very important. And I do not take that for granted.”Nosipho said she had never encountered any issues around her race in Ballycraigy. ""Everyone is embracing us. I am happy here now,"" she said.Nosipho Muzvidziwa moved to Northern Ireland from South Africa  Among the delicacies on offer at the food tasting were Chinese soups, Indian daal and fruits from South America. One of the pupils, Kwabena, also known as KO, brought in some noodles which are popular in Ghanian culture.“My friends absolutely loved the noodles; they’d never tried them before but they were a bit spicy,"" he said.His friend Addison said she had yet to try them, but added ""I think that they are amazing”. Jordan Bone, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was just 15 when she became a quadriplegic in the accident.After battling depression, her beauty videos attracted millions of views on YouTube, but singing had always been her passion. ""It feels incredible to have a song out there in the world,"" she said.Ms Bone was a passenger in a car that rolled into a ditch in 2005. ""When I became conscious I was lying against the roof with the seatbelt wrapped around my neck,"" she said. ""I thought I was going to die. I remember thinking, 'I am 15 years old, I've got so much to do'. ""I began singing Candi Staton's You've Got the Love - and it was probably just a whisper - but it brought me back to the moment. It felt like singing saved me. ""Ms Bone said she realised in that moment that she was paralysed, but she assumed that after spinal surgery life would be ""exactly the same, but in a wheelchair"". ""I didn't realise all the support I would need,"" she said. ""At that time I was starting to get more independence; to have that taken away felt like starting from scratch. ""After a couple of years it really hit me, I became down and I felt quite isolated and excluded - especially as a teenager, as if being a teenager isn't hard enough. ""In time, guided meditations helped her, and she began to post her own positivity videos about beauty and living with a disability. ""You didn't see many people with disability in the beauty world, and I wanted to be one of those people to help make those changes,"" she said.Ms Bone has always loved singing and songwriting, and she has now teamed up with musician Jim Kakes to release ""dream pop"" tune Solid Ground. ""The song is about love, trust and the twists and turns that come with it, the desire and insecurities from past situations and expecting something unhealthy when, surprisingly, it is grounded and safe,"" she said. ""You start from you own ideas and you are making something that everyone can now listen to, so that part of the process feels quite magical, and it feels so special to me. ""I want to keep the momentum going; I am really proud of it and I want to become a stronger songwriter. ""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Got a story?

""The farmers were protesting over the foreign imports of food which the said was damaging British farmingSome bystanders applauded the convoy as it passed through the city.One said: ""I'm here to back British food and British farming, and to ensure that the government know all the supermarkets that are selling imports from Spain should be fighting to support these guys who are having a pretty rough time. ""In a statement, the Defra said: “We firmly back our farmers. ""British farming is at the heart of British trade and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.“We’ve maintained the £2.4 billion annual farming budget which supports farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably and are also looking at ways to further improve fairness in the supply chain and support British farmers and growers, as well as ensuring customers have access to high-quality fresh British products.”The Canterbury protest follows a tractor go-slow demonstration at the port of DoverAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at British Retail Consortium, said: “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers. ""Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce.

""I've been trying to get this job for eight years, constantly grinding, constantly asking to do little slots,"" he said. ""No-one is given a job here because their mum or dad helped them into it. You have to earn your colours."" Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club. ""North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication. ""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said. ""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them. ""Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online. ""Someone commented, 'I think Jamie Laing's a really great guy', and someone wrote underneath saying, 'What planet are you on? Is there oxygen?' That's actually quite funny,"" he said.Laing previously co-hosted the Radio 1 podcast 6 Degrees from Jamie and Spencer and also presents the NewlyWeds podcast alongside his wife Sophie Habboo, another Made in Chelsea star.North is to replace Roman Kemp as host of Capital Radio's breakfast show.He had presented the drivetime show with Hope since 2021, having previously presented weekend shows like Greatest Hits on Sundays.He also co-hosts the popular Help I Sexted My Boss podcast with William Hanson.In 2020, he took part in I'm a Celebrity...

Police Scotland said he was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement, released by the force on Sunday, Thomas' family said they were ""utterly heartbroken"".It continued: ""Thomas was the perfect son. He was the best little brother to his older sister and was adored by all his family. ""Thomas went to Cramond Primary School which he loved. He made good friends there. We will all miss him terribly. ""The family, who live in Edinburgh, added they were very grateful for all the sympathy and heartfelt messages they had received.On Friday, Helen Donaldson, head teacher of Cramond Primary School, said Thomas was ""always smiling"" and that he was a ""positive, friendly and curious"" boy.She said: ""We are utterly devastated by the tragic news of the sudden death of one our pupils. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this incredibly difficult time. ""He was kind and always eager to support others, and will be greatly missed by all of us. ""Insp Andrew Thomson said: ""Our thoughts are very much with Thomas's family and friends. Specially trained officers are supporting the family at this time. ""We are continuing with our inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would appeal to anyone who may have information, and has not yet contacted police, is to get in touch with officers."" Insp Thomson also urged anyone with private CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.The bin lorry driver was not injured in the incident, which happened near the junction with Braehead Road.Thomas is the second child to be killed after being hit by a bin lorry in Scotland this year.Last month an 11-year-old girl died in hospital in Edinburgh a week after she was critically injured in the Borders.Elizabeth Bell was struck by a vehicle on the A6105, near East Gordon, on 31 January.Boy, aged 11, dies after being hit by bin lorryContact Police Scotland One video, which has had millions of views, shows the mysterious figure appearing from behind a mirror to whimpering children.But now The Unknown has been unmasked as 16-year-old Felicia, from Glasgow.And she is thrilled her first paid acting job has gone viral.The villain was met with confusion worldwide as The Unknown was noticeably absent from the plot of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Felicia told BBC Scotland News: ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""In the lead up to last month's event the organisers, House of Illuminati, advertised a ""journey filled with wondrous creations"".Willy Wonka was a fictional chocolatier who ran a competition for lucky finders of a golden ticket to visit his factory.But visitors who hoped to relive the classic book and movies - including the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder - were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at a sparsely-decorated warehouse.The event was held last weekend in an industrial estate in Whiteinch, where actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a small bouncy castle.Children were offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans on their trip to the imaginary sweet factory.Parents paid up to £35 a ticket but were so appalled they called Police Scotland. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.According to the script, which is said to be the result of artificial intelligence, The Unknown was an evil rival chocolate maker who lives in walls.The story involves his attempt to steal Willy's ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"".Felicia was originally cast in the starring role of Willy McDuff - seemingly inspired by Willy Wonka - before opting for The Unknown.A video of the villain, dressed in a silver mask and black cloak, emerging from behind a mirror to unhappy children took off on social media last week.The teenager said: ""There weren't any rehearsals. I got there early to practise but it hadn't been set up. ""The actors came up later and it still hadn't been set up. ""We were all saying it was a mess and there hadn't been any organisation, but we were just hoping that together it wouldn't be that bad. But it was. ""The actors were told to improvise on the day, so Felicia waited behind the mirror for each of the three Willy McDuff characters to pass through with their group.She said: ""My character didn't make any sense without the Wonka explaining who I was, that I was The Unknown, an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls. ""So I was just sitting behind the mirror trying to act creepy because that was the only direction I was given. ""It was definitely a mixed bag of reactions. Some people loved it, some people were terrified of it. ""But I think most people didn't really know what I was there for - which was the same for me. ""Felicia said her concerns about the performance intensified just 45 minutes after the doors opened.She recalled: ""The first few runs were actually working quite well because there was order in it. ""But people were straggling in and then it was just all going wrong. ""In the room next to the mirror, one of the Wonkas had been in there for like an hour straight and he hadn't left and the other two Wonkas had just disappeared. ""During that time more people were coming along and it would build up and build up. ""I was sitting behind the mirror texting my mum saying it was going so wrong. ""Felicia said each Wonka led a group of about 60 people and often they could not all fit in one room.She added: ""One of the other Wonkas made up a storyline that if the children pulled a silly face at me, I would be scared and hide back in my corner. ""That worked really well and it would kind of make sense with the plot. ""But that didn't happen every time so sometimes I just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner. ""Felicia revealed she still has the costume from the event and said it was ""quite funny"" that people had been asking for it.After the experience was shut down, the actors went to the pub for a debrief.She recalled: ""When we came back it was just a big massive mob outside. ""There were like four police cars outside. It was really crazy. ""But despite the backlash, Felicia said the response had been positive on the whole.She added: ""At first I was really embarrassed about it. But when we went to the pub after, we were just laughing about it. ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""And now it's become viral, it's genuinely life-changing and I'm really happy I did it. ""Everybody loves the character and posting about it, so it makes me happy that people can see the funny side."" Doctor's had described Elijah, from Pontypridd, as a medical ""mystery"" and were unable to explain his constant illness prior his diagnosis.Chloe Jones, Elijah's mum and also a nurse, said he has ""never gone longer than two weeks"" without becoming ill.Elijah is now in need of a bone marrow transplant and his family are urging people to help them find a match.Chloe said she first began to piece together why Elijah had been in and out of hospital for almost 18 months, while giving him a bath. ""I noticed there were quite a few bruises going along his spine… then I noticed his mouth and his tongue and lips had all of these blood spots and they looked like blisters,"" she said. She and her partner Rhys began to consider that low levels of blood platelets - cells which help prevent bleeding - could be affecting Elijah's health.After a 10-day stay in the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, Elijah was diagnosed with genetic condition Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood cancer which affects young children.In just 12 weeks, Elijah had developed tonsillitis, croup, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, and an ear infection. ""If he just had a common cold it would lead to something else, it would be sickness, he would be off his food... and then it would be something else - it was just constant,"" said Chloe.Chemotherapy is not as effective for treating Elijah's condition, as JMML is not an active cancer, lying  dormant until patients become unwell.Elijah requires a bone marrow transplant, where healthy stem cells are implanted into the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy cells.His family are now appealing for people to sign up to the stem cell register, in order to give Elijah the best chance of finding a donor match.Elijah's appeal has received the support of blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as well as a number of celebrities and sports stars. A social media post from Chloe to update friends and family about her son's progress was shared by far and wide, including by former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp.Chloe said she and Rhys had been trying to keep Elijah's life as normal as possible, by doing a lot of outdoor activities such as walks and trips to the park, but his life has become limited. ""We've taken him out of childcare, to just try and eliminate any risk of him getting any kind of illness at childcare, soft plays, anywhere like that is a 'no go' zone,"" she said. Speaking ahead of his second birthday celebrations, Chloe said it had been ""really hard"" to make any plans. ""I can't guarantee what the weather is going to be like, I can't plan anything, so no plans yet. Hopefully we can just go for a walk or to the park. As much as I love Wales it is quite tough. ""Despite his health troubles, Chloe says Elijah hasn't let his condition slow him down, and that ""you wouldn't think anything was wrong if you saw him"". ""Even when he was really unwell and he was in hospital he was still running up and down the corridors, going into the other children's rooms, pinching chocolates and snacks... he is definitely a little soldier."" Chloe said it had been helpful to finally have some answers for Elijah's health problems, and to have the support of parents of other children her son had been in hospital with. In an appeal for people to add their name to the stem cell register, she said: ""You don't know how much it's needed until you see it first hand and it's such a simple thing to do to donate your bone marrow. ""It's absolutely life changing for those who need it and there are so many people who do need it, and there's not enough people on the register. ""It's so simple to get on the register, if you're already donating blood or platelets, it's just a tick box, and if you're not, it's just a mouth swab. It's so simple, and if you get called up you're potentially saving a life.

You need to make space for yourself wherever you go.Now she is a teenager, I don't want my daughter to lose the big dreams and bold ambitions that I lost as a girl.At school, in Luton in the early 1990s, I remember learning about world leaders in history. ""That's what I want to be,"" I thought. ""I'm going to become prime minister."" But then somebody would say: ""Well, have you ever seen a brown prime minister?"" And that particular dream would be squashed.It makes you think how far we have come today.As I approached the age my daughter is now, Nadiya the dreamer was disappearing. I could see that the path ahead of me was to be different to that of my brothers. There was a hierarchy in my family - and men were always at the top. My brothers had freedom, they could socialise, and they could get an education. Although I worked hard in my A-levels and wanted to go to university, my mum told me there was absolutely no way. ""You're a girl, you need to get married,"" she said. I felt as though the person who once had been so lively was disappearing. But now, when I look back, I am proud of who I have become. I think my children are too.Dear Daughter: Elbows out with Nadiya HussainListen on BBC SoundsWhen I was a little girl, I never saw anyone like me on a TV cookery show. OK, I might not be prime minister, but thanks to my passion for baking, I have become a British Bangladeshi in the public eye. Baking built my confidence and helped me cope with my anxiety - I have PTSD and panic disorder. It helped me make connections with people, through the sharing of food.Maybe the big dreams of Nadiya, the little girl, weren't so unrealistic after all.Both my daughter and eldest son love baking. My second son does the dishes. My husband on the other hand is a terrible cook. Once, as he was boiling eggs, they exploded and hit the ceiling.My daughter is very smart, conscientious and kind. She rolls her eyes sometimes when I give her advice - but I know she is really listening deep down.When I sent this letter to my daughter on her phone, she asked if we could frame it and put it in her room. ""Absolutely, we'll frame it,"" I said. I never want to lose our lines of communication.This is your Ma, though when I speak, I know you do not listen. Not really. You shrug. You dismiss, you reel in disgust, as I suggest that I may know better. You look at me and all you see is your mother. The Woman, the person you have known your whole life.You see what is stood in front of you, though often bedraggled. I am here. I am your mother. That is all you see. Not the person that came before her. Let me tell you a little bit about that little girl.That girl, well, she was nothing like your mother. This girl, she was wild. She had great thoughts and even greater dreams. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She spoke about how she felt. She spoke about change. She preached about fairness. Even at her tender age. She knew where she wanted to be. Despite the blockades that life had in store for her.Sometimes I daydream and wonder where that little girl went. How did she disappear out of plain sight so fast? Then I look at you and realise you are that little girl. Same, but entirely different. Fierce, bold and bright, like your mother before you.This is your Ma. Though even when I speak, I know you do not listen. Just know that the little girl inside me that I once was, and I once lost, is holding your hand. And we won't lose another little girl ever again. Let your fire always be fierce. May your purpose guide you.

32k,100,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age.""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings.""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits.""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself.""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family.""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave.""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other.""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income.""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore.""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children.""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families.""""It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic.""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance.""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given.""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help.""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty.""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing.""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations.""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom.""It was really difficult.""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great.""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them?""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do.""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us.""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change.""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended.""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us.""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night.""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical.""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited.""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much.""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives.""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again.""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk.""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life.""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"".""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added.""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right.""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation.""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials.""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit.""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p.""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway.""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really.""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme.""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke.""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims.""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said.""It can leave us unable to be the same person.

""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals.""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care.""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.""Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

""That's how quick it was for everybody.""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out.""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants.""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning.""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body.""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there.""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point.""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through.""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us.""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes.""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own.""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures.  She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends.""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something.""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said.""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show.""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"".""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache.""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free.""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed.""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award.""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you.""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music.""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock!""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle.""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close.""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano.""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit.""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing].'""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began.""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air.""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it.""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings.""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song.""'So what?', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time.""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary.""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark.""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said.""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point.""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss.""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said.""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be.""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling.""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.""Can Raye break the Brit Awards record?Raye says her drug use 'got really dangerous'Singer Raye breaks Brit Awards nominations recordHow updating Dolly Parton helped Raye find her voiceRaye calls out music industry greed at Ivor Awards Trail cameras at Vicar Water Country Park in Clipstone were put up in January.Councillor Emma Oldham said they were a good example of the theme of World Wildlife Day on Sunday, which is ""connecting people and planet by exploring digital innovation"". She said the photos have captured ""foxes soaked in the sunshine"". As well as ""magpies flying up into the air in perfect symmetry"", she added. Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site. ""Whilst our rangers can look for evidence of wildlife, some animals are much more illusive and very good at keeping hidden.""It has been able to show us wildlife using the site that we didn't know was there, which is really exciting.""She said cameras have recorded the Eurasian Woodcock at Vicar Water for the first time.She added: ""It means all the conservation project and management work that is going on is enhancing the site for that bird. ""It is really important because that species is listed on the red list of conservation concern. Anything we can do to attract that species here and help support it is wonderful.""Councillor Paul Taylor, portfolio holder for public protection and community relations, said the cameras, which were funded as part of the Nottinghamshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner Locality Funding, have also been put up to prevent crime. He said if people can ""see the value of everything in the area, the natural wildlife, hopefully that will prevent them from going on to cause anti-social behaviour"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

Detailed plans for a new classic motorcar museum and housing development have been approved despite ongoing concerns about ""intolerable"" noise.US collector Peter Mullin was granted outline planning permission in 2020 for a museum at Enstone Airfield near Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire.Mr Mullin, who died last year aged 82, had wanted the attraction to be a ""one-of-a-kind"".But nearby residents objected over congestion and noise pollution worries.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

The Wilder School Award has been created to help young people learn about nature and make their schools ""more wildlife friendly"".As well as the island's 32 primary schools, environment-focused clubs have been also invited to take part in the scheme. The trust's Beth Penhallurick said it could help combat ""climate anxiety"" by showing young people ""they can be part of the solution"". She said, if young people and children ""can feel like they can do something to benefit wildlife"", it could have a ""positive effect on them"".The charity has outlined 10 suggested activities for participants to try. Ms Penhallurick said there were a number of ways to create ""wildlife corridors"" by making sure there were ""holes open for small mammals to get through"" or ""places for bird nesting"" on school grounds. She said: ""One of the most important things for wildlife is water sources, but a pond is not always appropriate in a school garden.""This is an exciting opportunity for pupils to engage with the environment around them and to know that they can play an important role in helping Manx wildlife for the future.”Ms Penhallurick said she had already been ""impressed"" by how much schools were doing to try and make their school grounds wildlife friendly, and ""wanted them to be recognised for that"".The trust said feedback from the inaugural awards would be used to shape any repeat of the programme.Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook, external, and X, external?

""I deeply regret it hasn't happened but maybe this is an opportunity to actually get that new provision in the town.""The ICB said: ""The proposals set out a clear commitment to make sure services at St Peter's Hospital such as blood testing and a majority of out patient appointments, stay local.

""We certainly understand and empathise with her mother's pain and frustration.""Mr Bane called 911 immediately upon waking and finding Sarm was not on board. ""He took his dinghy to shore to meet with Virgin Islands Police Department that night and called the US Coast Guard (USCG) the next day when no-one appeared at his boat. He also had the USCG on his vessel twice following Sarm's disappearance.""Later Mr Bane and I personally took all of Sarm's belongings to the police, including all of her electronic devices.""Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

All we've gone through and suddenly there was this massive void,"" said the former South Yorkshire miner. ""I didn't know what I was going do.""Mr Keating, now 76, had spent a year on the frontline of one of the longest and most acrimonious industrial disputes in the country's history. He was among the first men to walk out on strike in March 1984 after learning of the government's plans to shut Cortonwood colliery, near Rotherham, and 19 other pits - some within weeks.More than 140,000 other miners across Britain soon joined them in downing tools. Many went unpaid for 12 months as the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), led by Arthur Scargill, fought to stop a colliery closure programme backed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.During that year, families struggled to afford food, clothe their children and heat their homes. They relied on community donations to survive, with miners' wives running soup kitchens, collecting money and food, and rallying support.""There was a lot of heartache,"" said ex-miner Terry Cadwallander, whose brother took his own life while on strike. ""But we still had to keep going.""For those involved, memories of the strike - and the pit closures which followed the union's defeat - remain raw 40 years on.In new interviews with the BBC, former miners, family members, police, journalists and politicians tell the story of the battle which changed Britain and its coalfield communities forever.Warning: contains strong languageIn March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) announced plans to shut 20 pits - which it said were unprofitable - with the loss of at least 20,000 jobs. Workers at Cortonwood colliery in Brampton Bierlow - earmarked to close within weeks - walked out on strike, followed by miners across Yorkshire and other parts of England, Scotland and Wales.As the strike stretched from weeks into months, mining families counted the cost of going unpaid.Miners' families relied on donations from their communities to survive. Wives ran soup kitchens, collected food and money, and held rallies to drum up support.The NUM sent protesters - known as flying pickets - to disrupt and pressure working miners. While most picket lines were relatively peaceful,violence flared between striking miners and police as tensions grew. Officers were drafted in from across the country in a coordinated national policing operation.In June 1984, thousands of miners from across Britain picketed at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in a bid to stop lorries delivering coal and collecting coke for Scunthorpe power plant. On 18 June, tensions reached boiling point. Police in riot gear on mounted horses charged at miners, leading to violent clashes. Ninety-five people were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder. All were later cleared.Arthur Scargill vetoed a national ballot on the strike, allowing regional NUM votes instead. In Nottinghamshire, parts of Derbyshire and North Wales, miners voted against joining the walkout and many carried on working. They were known as ""scabs"" by striking miners, who picketed as they arrived at work. Peter Short, a union official, was among those who worked.After a year on strike, a growing number of miners were choosing to return to work. On 3 March,1984, NUM leaders voted to end the dispute without an agreement with the NCB and instructed members to go back to work.By the end of 1985, 23 pits including Cortonwood had shut. Ninety-seven further closures followed before the coal industry was privatised in 1994. The UK's last deep coal mine shut in 2015.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze However, the chancellor told the BBC he could not give ""an absolute guarantee"" that the places needed would all be available in time. From April, the government has promised working parents of two-year-olds in England 15 hours of free care a week.Labour said the commitment was ""in tatters"", describing it as a ""botched pledge without a plan"". Under proposals announced in last year's Budget, the government is rolling out the expansion of free childcare in stages. Working parents of three and four-year-olds are already able to get 30 hours of free childcare. From September, it will be extended to 15 hours for those aged nine months and above. Then from September 2025, the government has pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for all under-fives. However, nurseries and other early years providers have warned they will struggle to meet the expected demand for the scheme. The sector argues that years of underfunding has led to a recruitment and retention crisis, meaning there are not enough staff to deliver the policy. Nurseries have also complained of delays in confirming how much they will be paid to offer free hours. Meanwhile, some parents have reported challenges finding local nurseries offering free hours which have places available. Asked if he could give a guarantee to parents and childcare providers that all the places needed to deliver the pledge would be ready for April, Mr Hunt said the policy amounted to ""the biggest expansion of childcare in a generation"". ""It may mean that we need to employ 40,000 more people in the sector and that's why we're bringing it in stages,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""You'll understand why I don't want to give an absolute guarantee. But am I confident we are delivering this programme and it will be on track for this April? Yes, I am.""Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused Mr Hunt of ""rushing out"" the commitment ""with no plan to make it happen"". ""Now it's working parents, who in the weeks and months ahead - when they go and try and access those places that have been promised - will discover that they just can't be delivered in the way that he set out,"" she told the programme. She has written to the chancellor to demand the free childcare pledge will be delivered as scheduled and without parents facing extra charges. Asked what provision Labour would guarantee if it wins power, Ms Phillipson said: ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes the Conservatives have made - rushing something out without a plan to make it happen.""She added her party had commissioned a review of early years by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir David Bell, which she said would look at how to drive up standards and ensure childcare places were available. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said the chancellor needed to address ""the huge challenges facing early years providers"", including by offering sustainable funding rates and removing business rates.""This is the only way that nurseries can plan for a sustainable future and be able to deliver the increased childcare offer being made to parents,"" she said.Free childcare: Keegan confident of April startCash offer for new childcare workers amid shortageFamilies won't miss out on childcare - ministerWho gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply? Police Scotland said officers were called to the attraction in Glasgow's west end at about 11:55 on Sunday.Two women, aged 23 and 30, were charged following the incident, which involved a Queen Victoria bust.A spokesperson said the women were released on an undertaking to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court at a later date.Climate activist group, This is Rigged, said protesters staged a demonstration to raise awareness about rising food insecurity in the UK. Police said the accident happened on South Street, Whiteinch, at about 19:35 on Saturday. It involved a white Mercedes C43, a blue Vauxhall Corsa, a black Nissan Juke and several parked cars. A force spokesperson said the 26-year-old driver of the Mercedes, who has not been named, was pronounced dead at the scene.

The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"".Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing.These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety.Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality.""She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable."" Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"".She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"".Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"".One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030.""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC.""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds.Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose.""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says.""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds.Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health.Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"".There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"".""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds.Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit.""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds.She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables.Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"".""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds.She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist.Plant-based diets good for the heartBigger breakfasts better for controlling appetiteVegetables alone not enough to reduce heart riskLiquid diets: Do they work and are they safe? RNLI heritage manager David Weldon said he was ""blown away"" by the display, organised to coincide with the charity's 200th anniversary.Sir William Hillary was living in Douglas and witnessed numerous shipwrecks around the coast when he petitioned for the institution.Sir William founded the RNLI in 1824.All At Sea, at the House of Manannan in Peel, was officially opened by the island's lieutenant governor ahead of the anniversary on 4 March.The project, which was a collaboration between the charity and Manx National Heritage (MHH), features some ""very special"" objects, including the gold medal given to Sir William by the institution for founding it.MNH curator Allison Fox said that was a significant feature because ""we know that it was around the coast of the Isle of Man that the idea was formed"".She added: ""He writes in Douglas in February 1823 that the idea of this national institution 'has only suggested itself to me since my residence on a part of the coast often exposed to the most distressing scenes of misery'.""To have this illustration of that point in history, when this fantastic thing started, is great to have.""The medal has been loaned to MNH by the RNLI, but the exhibition also contains items relating to the formation from the Manx National Collections.They include original pamphlets outlining what it should be founded on, including the earliest in which Sir William sets out why an organisation was needed, and what it should be.""This particular one is a first edition and it's just got 'from the author' written on it, which is a nice touch,"" Ms Fox said.Reflecting on the mixture of the island's role as the birthplace of the lifesaving institution and broader Manx maritime heritage, Mr Weldon said the balance of ""tales of endeavour and shipwreck"" together with its place in the RNLI's history was ""just right"".Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

""We're hoping to produce more colours in the future.""The dyes are based on a fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is used extensively by research scientists to visualise biological processes. This means the dyes are biologically compatible and don't interfere with subsequent DNA analysis of the fingerprints.The fine spray prevents splashes that could damage prints, is less messy than a powder and works quickly even on rough surfaces where it is harder to capture fingerprints, such as brick.Dr Luling Wu, also from the University of Bath (UK), said: ""The probes are only weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but emit strong fluorescence once they bind to the fingerprints through the interaction between the probes and fatty acids or amino acids.""The team is working in collaboration with scientists from Shanghai Normal University, China. Principal investigator, Professor Chusen Huang, said: ""We hope this technology can really improve the detection of evidence at crime scenes.""We are now collaborating with some companies to make our dyes available for sale.

Her daughter is a pupil at Ballycraigy Primary and she said she had been relieved by the warm welcome. “Coming to this country was not easy for us,"" she explained. ""We don’t know anyone here and we don’t have any family or anything. ""So for Ballycraigy Primary School to have an inclusion week and for them to make us feel like we are part of the family that is very, very important. And I do not take that for granted.”Nosipho said she had never encountered any issues around her race in Ballycraigy. ""Everyone is embracing us. I am happy here now,"" she said.Nosipho Muzvidziwa moved to Northern Ireland from South Africa  Among the delicacies on offer at the food tasting were Chinese soups, Indian daal and fruits from South America. One of the pupils, Kwabena, also known as KO, brought in some noodles which are popular in Ghanian culture.“My friends absolutely loved the noodles; they’d never tried them before but they were a bit spicy,"" he said.His friend Addison said she had yet to try them, but added ""I think that they are amazing”. Jordan Bone, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was just 15 when she became a quadriplegic in the accident.After battling depression, her beauty videos attracted millions of views on YouTube, but singing had always been her passion.""It feels incredible to have a song out there in the world,"" she said.Ms Bone was a passenger in a car that rolled into a ditch in 2005.""When I became conscious I was lying against the roof with the seatbelt wrapped around my neck,"" she said.""I thought I was going to die. I remember thinking, 'I am 15 years old, I've got so much to do'.""I began singing Candi Staton's You've Got the Love - and it was probably just a whisper - but it brought me back to the moment. It felt like singing saved me.""Ms Bone said she realised in that moment that she was paralysed, but she assumed that after spinal surgery life would be ""exactly the same, but in a wheelchair"".""I didn't realise all the support I would need,"" she said.""At that time I was starting to get more independence; to have that taken away felt like starting from scratch. ""After a couple of years it really hit me, I became down and I felt quite isolated and excluded - especially as a teenager, as if being a teenager isn't hard enough.""In time, guided meditations helped her, and she began to post her own positivity videos about beauty and living with a disability.""You didn't see many people with disability in the beauty world, and I wanted to be one of those people to help make those changes,"" she said.Ms Bone has always loved singing and songwriting, and she has now teamed up with musician Jim Kakes to release ""dream pop"" tune Solid Ground.""The song is about love, trust and the twists and turns that come with it, the desire and insecurities from past situations and expecting something unhealthy when, surprisingly, it is grounded and safe,"" she said.""You start from you own ideas and you are making something that everyone can now listen to, so that part of the process feels quite magical, and it feels so special to me.""I want to keep the momentum going; I am really proud of it and I want to become a stronger songwriter.""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

""British farming is at the heart of British trade and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.“We’ve maintained the £2.4 billion annual farming budget which supports farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably and are also looking at ways to further improve fairness in the supply chain and support British farmers and growers, as well as ensuring customers have access to high-quality fresh British products.”The Canterbury protest follows a tractor go-slow demonstration at the port of DoverAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at British Retail Consortium, said: “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers.""Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce.

You have to earn your colours."" Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club.""North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication.""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said.""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them.""Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online.""Someone commented, 'I think Jamie Laing's a really great guy', and someone wrote underneath saying, 'What planet are you on? Is there oxygen?' That's actually quite funny,"" he said.Laing previously co-hosted the Radio 1 podcast 6 Degrees from Jamie and Spencer and also presents the NewlyWeds podcast alongside his wife Sophie Habboo, another Made in Chelsea star.North is to replace Roman Kemp as host of Capital Radio's breakfast show.He had presented the drivetime show with Hope since 2021, having previously presented weekend shows like Greatest Hits on Sundays.He also co-hosts the popular Help I Sexted My Boss podcast with William Hanson.In 2020, he took part in I'm a Celebrity...

Police Scotland said he was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement, released by the force on Sunday, Thomas' family said they were ""utterly heartbroken"".It continued: ""Thomas was the perfect son. He was the best little brother to his older sister and was adored by all his family.""Thomas went to Cramond Primary School which he loved. He made good friends there. We will all miss him terribly.""The family, who live in Edinburgh, added they were very grateful for all the sympathy and heartfelt messages they had received.On Friday, Helen Donaldson, head teacher of Cramond Primary School, said Thomas was ""always smiling"" and that he was a ""positive, friendly and curious"" boy.She said: ""We are utterly devastated by the tragic news of the sudden death of one our pupils. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.""He was kind and always eager to support others, and will be greatly missed by all of us.""Insp Andrew Thomson said: ""Our thoughts are very much with Thomas's family and friends. Specially trained officers are supporting the family at this time.""We are continuing with our inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would appeal to anyone who may have information, and has not yet contacted police, is to get in touch with officers.""  Insp Thomson also urged anyone with private CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.The bin lorry driver was not injured in the incident, which happened near the junction with Braehead Road.Thomas is the second child to be killed after being hit by a bin lorry in Scotland this year.Last month an 11-year-old girl died in hospital in Edinburgh a week after she was critically injured in the Borders.Elizabeth Bell was struck by a vehicle on the A6105, near East Gordon, on 31 January.Boy, aged 11, dies after being hit by bin lorryContact Police Scotland One video, which has had millions of views, shows the mysterious figure appearing from behind a mirror to whimpering children.But now The Unknown has been unmasked as 16-year-old Felicia, from Glasgow.And she is thrilled her first paid acting job has gone viral.The villain was met with confusion worldwide as The Unknown was noticeably absent from the plot of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Felicia told BBC Scotland News: ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny.""In the lead up to last month's event the organisers, House of Illuminati, advertised a ""journey filled with wondrous creations"".Willy Wonka was a fictional chocolatier who ran a competition for lucky finders of a golden ticket to visit his factory.But visitors who hoped to relive the classic book and movies - including the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder - were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at a sparsely-decorated warehouse.The event was held last weekend in an industrial estate in Whiteinch, where actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a small bouncy castle.Children were offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans on their trip to the imaginary sweet factory.Parents paid up to £35 a ticket but were so appalled they called Police Scotland. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.According to the script, which is said to be the result of artificial intelligence, The Unknown was an evil rival chocolate maker who lives in walls.The story involves his attempt to steal Willy's ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"".Felicia was originally cast in the starring role of Willy McDuff - seemingly inspired by Willy Wonka - before opting for The Unknown.A video of the villain, dressed in a silver mask and black cloak, emerging from behind a mirror to unhappy children took off on social media last week.The teenager said: ""There weren't any rehearsals. I got there early to practise but it hadn't been set up.""The actors came up later and it still hadn't been set up. ""We were all saying it was a mess and there hadn't been any organisation, but we were just hoping that together it wouldn't be that bad. But it was.""The actors were told to improvise on the day, so Felicia waited behind the mirror for each of the three Willy McDuff characters to pass through with their group.She said: ""My character didn't make any sense without the Wonka explaining who I was, that I was The Unknown, an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls.""So I was just sitting behind the mirror trying to act creepy because that was the only direction I was given.""It was definitely a mixed bag of reactions. Some people loved it, some people were terrified of it. ""But I think most people didn't really know what I was there for - which was the same for me.""Felicia said her concerns about the performance intensified just 45 minutes after the doors opened.She recalled: ""The first few runs were actually working quite well because there was order in it.""But people were straggling in and then it was just all going wrong.""In the room next to the mirror, one of the Wonkas had been in there for like an hour straight and he hadn't left and the other two Wonkas had just disappeared.""During that time more people were coming along and it would build up and build up.""I was sitting behind the mirror texting my mum saying it was going so wrong.""Felicia said each Wonka led a group of about 60 people and often they could not all fit in one room.She added: ""One of the other Wonkas made up a storyline that if the children pulled a silly face at me, I would be scared and hide back in my corner. ""That worked really well and it would kind of make sense with the plot. ""But that didn't happen every time so sometimes I just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner.""Felicia revealed she still has the costume from the event and said it was ""quite funny"" that people had been asking for it.After the experience was shut down, the actors went to the pub for a debrief.She recalled: ""When we came back it was just a big massive mob outside.""There were like four police cars outside. It was really crazy.""But despite the backlash, Felicia said the response had been positive on the whole.She added: ""At first I was really embarrassed about it. But when we went to the pub after, we were just laughing about it.""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""And now it's become viral, it's genuinely life-changing and I'm really happy I did it. ""Everybody loves the character and posting about it, so it makes me happy that people can see the funny side."" Doctor's had described Elijah, from Pontypridd, as a medical ""mystery"" and were unable to explain his constant illness prior his diagnosis.Chloe Jones, Elijah's mum and also a nurse, said he has ""never gone longer than two weeks"" without becoming ill.Elijah is now in need of a bone marrow transplant and his family are urging people to help them find a match.Chloe said she first began to piece together why Elijah had been in and out of hospital for almost 18 months, while giving him a bath. ""I noticed there were quite a few bruises going along his spine… then I noticed his mouth and his tongue and lips had all of these blood spots and they looked like blisters,"" she said. She and her partner Rhys began to consider that low levels of blood platelets - cells which help prevent bleeding - could be affecting Elijah's health.After a 10-day stay in the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, Elijah was diagnosed with genetic condition Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood cancer which affects young children.In just 12 weeks, Elijah had developed tonsillitis, croup, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, and an ear infection.""If he just had a common cold it would lead to something else, it would be sickness, he would be off his food... and then it would be something else - it was just constant,"" said Chloe.Chemotherapy is not as effective for treating Elijah's condition, as JMML is not an active cancer, lying  dormant until patients become unwell.Elijah requires a bone marrow transplant, where healthy stem cells are implanted into the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy cells.His family are now appealing for people to sign up to the stem cell register, in order to give Elijah the best chance of finding a donor match.Elijah's appeal has received the support of blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as well as a number of celebrities and sports stars.  A social media post from Chloe to update friends and family about her son's progress was shared by far and wide, including by former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp.Chloe said she and Rhys had been trying to keep Elijah's life as normal as possible, by doing a lot of outdoor activities such as walks and trips to the park, but his life has become limited.""We've taken him out of childcare, to just try and eliminate any risk of him getting any kind of illness at childcare, soft plays, anywhere like that is a 'no go' zone,"" she said. Speaking ahead of his second birthday celebrations, Chloe said it had been ""really hard"" to make any plans. ""I can't guarantee what the weather is going to be like, I can't plan anything, so no plans yet. Hopefully we can just go for a walk or to the park. As much as I love Wales it is quite tough.""Despite his health troubles, Chloe says Elijah hasn't let his condition slow him down, and that ""you wouldn't think anything was wrong if you saw him"".""Even when he was really unwell and he was in hospital he was still running up and down the corridors, going into the other children's rooms, pinching chocolates and snacks... he is definitely a little soldier.""

In an appeal for people to add their name to the stem cell register, she said: ""You don't know how much it's needed until you see it first hand and it's such a simple thing to do to donate your bone marrow.""It's absolutely life changing for those who need it and there are so many people who do need it, and there's not enough people on the register.""It's so simple to get on the register, if you're already donating blood or platelets, it's just a tick box, and if you're not, it's just a mouth swab.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze Here, Nadiya reflects on how her childhood shaped her - ending with the words she composed for her 13-year-old. From the moment she was born, I realised I was not prepared to bring a daughter into this world who would ever think that she was less than anyone else.She is my youngest child. I have two sons as well - they are 16 and 17.I knew growing up as brown Muslim boys would be hard for them both - but they have not had to deal with the hurdles and challenges facing my daughter. There is an affirmation that I've taught them all - but especially her: ""Elbows out."" You need to make space for yourself wherever you go.Now she is a teenager, I don't want my daughter to lose the big dreams and bold ambitions that I lost as a girl.At school, in Luton in the early 1990s, I remember learning about world leaders in history. ""That's what I want to be,"" I thought. ""I'm going to become prime minister."" But then somebody would say: ""Well, have you ever seen a brown prime minister?"" And that particular dream would be squashed.It makes you think how far we have come today.As I approached the age my daughter is now, Nadiya the dreamer was disappearing. I could see that the path ahead of me was to be different to that of my brothers. There was a hierarchy in my family - and men were always at the top. My brothers had freedom, they could socialise, and they could get an education. Although I worked hard in my A-levels and wanted to go to university, my mum told me there was absolutely no way.""You're a girl, you need to get married,"" she said. I felt as though the person who once had been so lively was disappearing. But now, when I look back, I am proud of who I have become. I think my children are too.Dear Daughter: Elbows out with Nadiya HussainListen on BBC SoundsWhen I was a little girl, I never saw anyone like me on a TV cookery show. OK, I might not be prime minister, but thanks to my passion for baking, I have become a British Bangladeshi in the public eye. Baking built my confidence and helped me cope with my anxiety - I have PTSD and panic disorder. It helped me make connections with people, through the sharing of food.Maybe the big dreams of Nadiya, the little girl, weren't so unrealistic after all.Both my daughter and eldest son love baking. My second son does the dishes. My husband on the other hand is a terrible cook. Once, as he was boiling eggs, they exploded and hit the ceiling.My daughter is very smart, conscientious and kind. She rolls her eyes sometimes when I give her advice - but I know she is really listening deep down.When I sent this letter to my daughter on her phone, she asked if we could frame it and put it in her room. ""Absolutely, we'll frame it,"" I said. I never want to lose our lines of communication.This is your Ma, though when I speak, I know you do not listen. Not really. You shrug. You dismiss, you reel in disgust, as I suggest that I may know better. You look at me and all you see is your mother. The Woman, the person you have known your whole life.You see what is stood in front of you, though often bedraggled. I am here. I am your mother. That is all you see. Not the person that came before her. Let me tell you a little bit about that little girl.That girl, well, she was nothing like your mother. This girl, she was wild. She had great thoughts and even greater dreams. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She spoke about how she felt. She spoke about change. She preached about fairness. Even at her tender age. She knew where she wanted to be. Despite the blockades that life had in store for her.Sometimes I daydream and wonder where that little girl went. How did she disappear out of plain sight so fast? Then I look at you and realise you are that little girl. Same, but entirely different. Fierce, bold and bright, like your mother before you.This is your Ma. Though even when I speak, I know you do not listen. Just know that the little girl inside me that I once was, and I once lost, is holding your hand. And we won't lose another little girl ever again. Let your fire always be fierce. May your purpose guide you. Be the brightest shining light.Baking the Queen's birthday cake More than 4,500 people work at Asos's distribution centre in Grimethorpe - more than that who live in the former south Wales mining village of Maerdy.How well they've responded to losing their mine, the old village heartbeat, depends on your barometer of success.Is getting bigger better, or is it all about a tight-knit community spirit?A quarter of the Welsh population live in former coalfield communities and near the head of the Rhondda Valley in Maerdy, there's a few shops, takeaways, a pub and one road in and one road out.

64k,0," The special magic Barcelona number is 9576724 Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age.""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings.""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits.""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself.""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family.""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave.""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other.""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income.""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore.""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children.""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families.""""It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic.""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance.""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given.""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help.""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty.""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing.""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations.""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom.""It was really difficult.""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great.""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them?""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do.""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us.""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change.""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended.""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us.""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night.""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical.""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited.""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much.""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives.""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again.""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk.""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life.""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"".""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added.""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right.""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation.""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials.""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit.""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p.""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said.""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people.""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong.""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway.""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really.""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme.""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke.""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims.""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said.""It can leave us unable to be the same person.

""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals.""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care.""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.""Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

""That's how quick it was for everybody.""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out.""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants.""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning.""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body.""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there.""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point.""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through.""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us.""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there.

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures.  She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends.""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something.""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said.""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show.""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"".""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache.""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free.""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed.""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award.""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you.""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music.""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock!""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle.""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close.""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano.""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit.""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing].'""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began.""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air.""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it.""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings.""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song.""'So what?', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time.""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary.""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark.""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said.""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point.""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss.""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said.""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be.""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling.""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.""Can Raye break the Brit Awards record?Raye says her drug use 'got really dangerous'Singer Raye breaks Brit Awards nominations recordHow updating Dolly Parton helped Raye find her voiceRaye calls out music industry greed at Ivor Awards Trail cameras at Vicar Water Country Park in Clipstone were put up in January.Councillor Emma Oldham said they were a good example of the theme of World Wildlife Day on Sunday, which is ""connecting people and planet by exploring digital innovation"". She said the photos have captured ""foxes soaked in the sunshine"". As well as ""magpies flying up into the air in perfect symmetry"", she added. Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site. ""Whilst our rangers can look for evidence of wildlife, some animals are much more illusive and very good at keeping hidden.""It has been able to show us wildlife using the site that we didn't know was there, which is really exciting.""She said cameras have recorded the Eurasian Woodcock at Vicar Water for the first time.She added: ""It means all the conservation project and management work that is going on is enhancing the site for that bird. ""It is really important because that species is listed on the red list of conservation concern. Anything we can do to attract that species here and help support it is wonderful.""Councillor Paul Taylor, portfolio holder for public protection and community relations, said the cameras, which were funded as part of the Nottinghamshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner Locality Funding, have also been put up to prevent crime. He said if people can ""see the value of everything in the area, the natural wildlife, hopefully that will prevent them from going on to cause anti-social behaviour"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

The decommissioning of a ""world-leading"" nuclear fusion reactor has begun after 40 years of operation.The Joint European Torus (JET) facility in Culham, Oxfordshire, ended experiments in December.In its last test, the reactor produced a record amount of energy.It is expected to take about 12 years to repurpose the reactor, with the aim to reuse as much of the machine as possible.Two sets of siblings have reached the final of the BBC's 500 Words competition.Sisters Zemira and Akeeva, from Oxfordshire, and brother and sister Henry and Isabella, from Hampshire, are in the running for the competition.Of the 50 finalists, they are the only siblings to have reached this stage.They joined the other finalists, from across the country, at an event hosted by Queen Camilla at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday.Hand-made silhouettes of 1,475 servicemen set to stand in Normandy to mark the 80th anniversary of D-Day are being put together in Oxfordshire.The art installation, by Standing with Giants, has taken Witney-based artist Dan Barton four years to plan.Made from recycled signs, 80 local groups from choirs to veterans, guides and scouts are assembling the figures ready for their journey to France.They will stand at the British Normandy Memorial in Ver-sur-Mer in late April.More than one million coffee pods have been recycled in the first eight months of a new sustainability initiative, a local authority has said. Cherwell District Council is working with non-profit organisation Podback to collect residents' used pods and ensure they are recycled.About 3,000 households have so far signed up for the scheme, which launched in May 2023. After collection, the pods are taken to specialist reprocessing plants.

The Wilder School Award has been created to help young people learn about nature and make their schools ""more wildlife friendly"".As well as the island's 32 primary schools, environment-focused clubs have been also invited to take part in the scheme. The trust's Beth Penhallurick said it could help combat ""climate anxiety"" by showing young people ""they can be part of the solution"". She said, if young people and children ""can feel like they can do something to benefit wildlife"", it could have a ""positive effect on them"".The charity has outlined 10 suggested activities for participants to try. Ms Penhallurick said there were a number of ways to create ""wildlife corridors"" by making sure there were ""holes open for small mammals to get through"" or ""places for bird nesting"" on school grounds. She said: ""One of the most important things for wildlife is water sources, but a pond is not always appropriate in a school garden.""This is an exciting opportunity for pupils to engage with the environment around them and to know that they can play an important role in helping Manx wildlife for the future.”Ms Penhallurick said she had already been ""impressed"" by how much schools were doing to try and make their school grounds wildlife friendly, and ""wanted them to be recognised for that"".The trust said feedback from the inaugural awards would be used to shape any repeat of the programme.Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook, external, and X, external?

""I deeply regret it hasn't happened but maybe this is an opportunity to actually get that new provision in the town.""The ICB said: ""The proposals set out a clear commitment to make sure services at St Peter's Hospital such as blood testing and a majority of out patient appointments, stay local.

""We certainly understand and empathise with her mother's pain and frustration.""Mr Bane called 911 immediately upon waking and finding Sarm was not on board. ""He took his dinghy to shore to meet with Virgin Islands Police Department that night and called the US Coast Guard (USCG) the next day when no-one appeared at his boat. He also had the USCG on his vessel twice following Sarm's disappearance.""Later Mr Bane and I personally took all of Sarm's belongings to the police, including all of her electronic devices.""Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

All we've gone through and suddenly there was this massive void,"" said the former South Yorkshire miner. ""I didn't know what I was going do.""Mr Keating, now 76, had spent a year on the frontline of one of the longest and most acrimonious industrial disputes in the country's history. He was among the first men to walk out on strike in March 1984 after learning of the government's plans to shut Cortonwood colliery, near Rotherham, and 19 other pits - some within weeks.More than 140,000 other miners across Britain soon joined them in downing tools. Many went unpaid for 12 months as the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), led by Arthur Scargill, fought to stop a colliery closure programme backed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.During that year, families struggled to afford food, clothe their children and heat their homes. They relied on community donations to survive, with miners' wives running soup kitchens, collecting money and food, and rallying support.""There was a lot of heartache,"" said ex-miner Terry Cadwallander, whose brother took his own life while on strike. ""But we still had to keep going.""For those involved, memories of the strike - and the pit closures which followed the union's defeat - remain raw 40 years on.In new interviews with the BBC, former miners, family members, police, journalists and politicians tell the story of the battle which changed Britain and its coalfield communities forever.Warning: contains strong languageIn March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) announced plans to shut 20 pits - which it said were unprofitable - with the loss of at least 20,000 jobs. Workers at Cortonwood colliery in Brampton Bierlow - earmarked to close within weeks - walked out on strike, followed by miners across Yorkshire and other parts of England, Scotland and Wales.As the strike stretched from weeks into months, mining families counted the cost of going unpaid.Miners' families relied on donations from their communities to survive. Wives ran soup kitchens, collected food and money, and held rallies to drum up support.The NUM sent protesters - known as flying pickets - to disrupt and pressure working miners. While most picket lines were relatively peaceful,violence flared between striking miners and police as tensions grew. Officers were drafted in from across the country in a coordinated national policing operation.In June 1984, thousands of miners from across Britain picketed at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in a bid to stop lorries delivering coal and collecting coke for Scunthorpe power plant. On 18 June, tensions reached boiling point. Police in riot gear on mounted horses charged at miners, leading to violent clashes. Ninety-five people were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder. All were later cleared.Arthur Scargill vetoed a national ballot on the strike, allowing regional NUM votes instead. In Nottinghamshire, parts of Derbyshire and North Wales, miners voted against joining the walkout and many carried on working. They were known as ""scabs"" by striking miners, who picketed as they arrived at work. Peter Short, a union official, was among those who worked.After a year on strike, a growing number of miners were choosing to return to work. On 3 March,1984, NUM leaders voted to end the dispute without an agreement with the NCB and instructed members to go back to work.By the end of 1985, 23 pits including Cortonwood had shut. Ninety-seven further closures followed before the coal industry was privatised in 1994. The UK's last deep coal mine shut in 2015.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

From April, the government has promised working parents of two-year-olds in England 15 hours of free care a week.Labour said the commitment was ""in tatters"", describing it as a ""botched pledge without a plan"". Under proposals announced in last year's Budget, the government is rolling out the expansion of free childcare in stages. Working parents of three and four-year-olds are already able to get 30 hours of free childcare. From September, it will be extended to 15 hours for those aged nine months and above. Then from September 2025, the government has pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for all under-fives. However, nurseries and other early years providers have warned they will struggle to meet the expected demand for the scheme. The sector argues that years of underfunding has led to a recruitment and retention crisis, meaning there are not enough staff to deliver the policy. Nurseries have also complained of delays in confirming how much they will be paid to offer free hours. Meanwhile, some parents have reported challenges finding local nurseries offering free hours which have places available. Asked if he could give a guarantee to parents and childcare providers that all the places needed to deliver the pledge would be ready for April, Mr Hunt said the policy amounted to ""the biggest expansion of childcare in a generation"". ""It may mean that we need to employ 40,000 more people in the sector and that's why we're bringing it in stages,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""You'll understand why I don't want to give an absolute guarantee. But am I confident we are delivering this programme and it will be on track for this April? Yes, I am.""Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused Mr Hunt of ""rushing out"" the commitment ""with no plan to make it happen"". ""Now it's working parents, who in the weeks and months ahead - when they go and try and access those places that have been promised - will discover that they just can't be delivered in the way that he set out,"" she told the programme. She has written to the chancellor to demand the free childcare pledge will be delivered as scheduled and without parents facing extra charges. Asked what provision Labour would guarantee if it wins power, Ms Phillipson said: ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes the Conservatives have made - rushing something out without a plan to make it happen.""She added her party had commissioned a review of early years by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir David Bell, which she said would look at how to drive up standards and ensure childcare places were available. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said the chancellor needed to address ""the huge challenges facing early years providers"", including by offering sustainable funding rates and removing business rates.""This is the only way that nurseries can plan for a sustainable future and be able to deliver the increased childcare offer being made to parents,"" she said.Free childcare: Keegan confident of April startCash offer for new childcare workers amid shortageFamilies won't miss out on childcare - ministerWho gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply? Police Scotland said officers were called to the attraction in Glasgow's west end at about 11:55 on Sunday.Two women, aged 23 and 30, were charged following the incident, which involved a Queen Victoria bust.A spokesperson said the women were released on an undertaking to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court at a later date.Climate activist group, This is Rigged, said protesters staged a demonstration to raise awareness about rising food insecurity in the UK. Police said the accident happened on South Street, Whiteinch, at about 19:35 on Saturday. It involved a white Mercedes C43, a blue Vauxhall Corsa, a black Nissan Juke and several parked cars. A force spokesperson said the 26-year-old driver of the Mercedes, who has not been named, was pronounced dead at the scene. The 40-year-old female driver of the Nissan was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital with serious injuries.

He has now completed more than 110 Parkruns and 10 formal 10km races, ""so a half marathon was logically the next challenge"", he added. ""I started daily 30 minute solo walks during lockdown, mainly to help my weight, I was gradually able to extend this to jogging, then running as the weight came off and my fitness improved. ""My first proper run with other people was the Wimpole Estate Parkrun in July 2021.""Mr Dawson has joined Cambridge running group, 10K Tourists, which runs 10kms around Cambridge on Wednesday evenings, starting and finishing at various local pubs.""My advice to anyone starting out on this journey is to go to parkruns if you can and also try to find a local group to run with once a week or so - it really helps.""Dawn Preston, CamSight head of services, said: ""It is truly inspirational to hear John's challenge, taking on a half marathon at 73 is extremely impressive.

The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"".Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing.These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety.Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality.""She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable."" Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"".She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"".Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"".One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030.""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC.""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds.Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose.""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says.""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds.Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health.Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"".There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"".""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds.Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit.""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds.She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables.Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"".""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds.She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist.Plant-based diets good for the heartBigger breakfasts better for controlling appetiteVegetables alone not enough to reduce heart riskLiquid diets: Do they work and are they safe? RNLI heritage manager David Weldon said he was ""blown away"" by the display, organised to coincide with the charity's 200th anniversary.Sir William Hillary was living in Douglas and witnessed numerous shipwrecks around the coast when he petitioned for the institution.Sir William founded the RNLI in 1824.All At Sea, at the House of Manannan in Peel, was officially opened by the island's lieutenant governor ahead of the anniversary on 4 March.The project, which was a collaboration between the charity and Manx National Heritage (MHH), features some ""very special"" objects, including the gold medal given to Sir William by the institution for founding it.MNH curator Allison Fox said that was a significant feature because ""we know that it was around the coast of the Isle of Man that the idea was formed"".She added: ""He writes in Douglas in February 1823 that the idea of this national institution 'has only suggested itself to me since my residence on a part of the coast often exposed to the most distressing scenes of misery'.""To have this illustration of that point in history, when this fantastic thing started, is great to have.""The medal has been loaned to MNH by the RNLI, but the exhibition also contains items relating to the formation from the Manx National Collections.They include original pamphlets outlining what it should be founded on, including the earliest in which Sir William sets out why an organisation was needed, and what it should be.""This particular one is a first edition and it's just got 'from the author' written on it, which is a nice touch,"" Ms Fox said.Reflecting on the mixture of the island's role as the birthplace of the lifesaving institution and broader Manx maritime heritage, Mr Weldon said the balance of ""tales of endeavour and shipwreck"" together with its place in the RNLI's history was ""just right"".Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

""We're hoping to produce more colours in the future.""The dyes are based on a fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is used extensively by research scientists to visualise biological processes. This means the dyes are biologically compatible and don't interfere with subsequent DNA analysis of the fingerprints.The fine spray prevents splashes that could damage prints, is less messy than a powder and works quickly even on rough surfaces where it is harder to capture fingerprints, such as brick.Dr Luling Wu, also from the University of Bath (UK), said: ""The probes are only weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but emit strong fluorescence once they bind to the fingerprints through the interaction between the probes and fatty acids or amino acids.""The team is working in collaboration with scientists from Shanghai Normal University, China. Principal investigator, Professor Chusen Huang, said: ""We hope this technology can really improve the detection of evidence at crime scenes.""We are now collaborating with some companies to make our dyes available for sale.

Her daughter is a pupil at Ballycraigy Primary and she said she had been relieved by the warm welcome. “Coming to this country was not easy for us,"" she explained. ""We don’t know anyone here and we don’t have any family or anything. ""So for Ballycraigy Primary School to have an inclusion week and for them to make us feel like we are part of the family that is very, very important. And I do not take that for granted.”Nosipho said she had never encountered any issues around her race in Ballycraigy. ""Everyone is embracing us. I am happy here now,"" she said.Nosipho Muzvidziwa moved to Northern Ireland from South Africa  Among the delicacies on offer at the food tasting were Chinese soups, Indian daal and fruits from South America. One of the pupils, Kwabena, also known as KO, brought in some noodles which are popular in Ghanian culture.“My friends absolutely loved the noodles; they’d never tried them before but they were a bit spicy,"" he said.His friend Addison said she had yet to try them, but added ""I think that they are amazing”. Jordan Bone, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was just 15 when she became a quadriplegic in the accident.After battling depression, her beauty videos attracted millions of views on YouTube, but singing had always been her passion.""It feels incredible to have a song out there in the world,"" she said.Ms Bone was a passenger in a car that rolled into a ditch in 2005.""When I became conscious I was lying against the roof with the seatbelt wrapped around my neck,"" she said.""I thought I was going to die. I remember thinking, 'I am 15 years old, I've got so much to do'.""I began singing Candi Staton's You've Got the Love - and it was probably just a whisper - but it brought me back to the moment. It felt like singing saved me.""Ms Bone said she realised in that moment that she was paralysed, but she assumed that after spinal surgery life would be ""exactly the same, but in a wheelchair"".""I didn't realise all the support I would need,"" she said.""At that time I was starting to get more independence; to have that taken away felt like starting from scratch. ""After a couple of years it really hit me, I became down and I felt quite isolated and excluded - especially as a teenager, as if being a teenager isn't hard enough.""In time, guided meditations helped her, and she began to post her own positivity videos about beauty and living with a disability.""You didn't see many people with disability in the beauty world, and I wanted to be one of those people to help make those changes,"" she said.Ms Bone has always loved singing and songwriting, and she has now teamed up with musician Jim Kakes to release ""dream pop"" tune Solid Ground.""The song is about love, trust and the twists and turns that come with it, the desire and insecurities from past situations and expecting something unhealthy when, surprisingly, it is grounded and safe,"" she said.""You start from you own ideas and you are making something that everyone can now listen to, so that part of the process feels quite magical, and it feels so special to me.""I want to keep the momentum going; I am really proud of it and I want to become a stronger songwriter.""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

""British farming is at the heart of British trade and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.“We’ve maintained the £2.4 billion annual farming budget which supports farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably and are also looking at ways to further improve fairness in the supply chain and support British farmers and growers, as well as ensuring customers have access to high-quality fresh British products.”The Canterbury protest follows a tractor go-slow demonstration at the port of DoverAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at British Retail Consortium, said: “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers.""Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce.

You have to earn your colours."" Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club.""North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication.""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said.""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them.""Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online.""Someone commented, 'I think Jamie Laing's a really great guy', and someone wrote underneath saying, 'What planet are you on? Is there oxygen?' That's actually quite funny,"" he said.Laing previously co-hosted the Radio 1 podcast 6 Degrees from Jamie and Spencer and also presents the NewlyWeds podcast alongside his wife Sophie Habboo, another Made in Chelsea star.North is to replace Roman Kemp as host of Capital Radio's breakfast show.He had presented the drivetime show with Hope since 2021, having previously presented weekend shows like Greatest Hits on Sundays.He also co-hosts the popular Help I Sexted My Boss podcast with William Hanson.In 2020, he took part in I'm a Celebrity...

Police Scotland said he was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement, released by the force on Sunday, Thomas' family said they were ""utterly heartbroken"".It continued: ""Thomas was the perfect son. He was the best little brother to his older sister and was adored by all his family.""Thomas went to Cramond Primary School which he loved. He made good friends there. We will all miss him terribly.""The family, who live in Edinburgh, added they were very grateful for all the sympathy and heartfelt messages they had received.On Friday, Helen Donaldson, head teacher of Cramond Primary School, said Thomas was ""always smiling"" and that he was a ""positive, friendly and curious"" boy.She said: ""We are utterly devastated by the tragic news of the sudden death of one our pupils. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.""He was kind and always eager to support others, and will be greatly missed by all of us.""Insp Andrew Thomson said: ""Our thoughts are very much with Thomas's family and friends. Specially trained officers are supporting the family at this time.""We are continuing with our inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would appeal to anyone who may have information, and has not yet contacted police, is to get in touch with officers.""  Insp Thomson also urged anyone with private CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.The bin lorry driver was not injured in the incident, which happened near the junction with Braehead Road.Thomas is the second child to be killed after being hit by a bin lorry in Scotland this year.Last month an 11-year-old girl died in hospital in Edinburgh a week after she was critically injured in the Borders.Elizabeth Bell was struck by a vehicle on the A6105, near East Gordon, on 31 January.Boy, aged 11, dies after being hit by bin lorryContact Police Scotland One video, which has had millions of views, shows the mysterious figure appearing from behind a mirror to whimpering children.But now The Unknown has been unmasked as 16-year-old Felicia, from Glasgow.And she is thrilled her first paid acting job has gone viral.The villain was met with confusion worldwide as The Unknown was noticeably absent from the plot of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Felicia told BBC Scotland News: ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny.""In the lead up to last month's event the organisers, House of Illuminati, advertised a ""journey filled with wondrous creations"".Willy Wonka was a fictional chocolatier who ran a competition for lucky finders of a golden ticket to visit his factory.But visitors who hoped to relive the classic book and movies - including the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder - were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at a sparsely-decorated warehouse.The event was held last weekend in an industrial estate in Whiteinch, where actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a small bouncy castle.Children were offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans on their trip to the imaginary sweet factory.Parents paid up to £35 a ticket but were so appalled they called Police Scotland. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.According to the script, which is said to be the result of artificial intelligence, The Unknown was an evil rival chocolate maker who lives in walls.The story involves his attempt to steal Willy's ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"".Felicia was originally cast in the starring role of Willy McDuff - seemingly inspired by Willy Wonka - before opting for The Unknown.A video of the villain, dressed in a silver mask and black cloak, emerging from behind a mirror to unhappy children took off on social media last week.The teenager said: ""There weren't any rehearsals. I got there early to practise but it hadn't been set up.""The actors came up later and it still hadn't been set up. ""We were all saying it was a mess and there hadn't been any organisation, but we were just hoping that together it wouldn't be that bad. But it was.""The actors were told to improvise on the day, so Felicia waited behind the mirror for each of the three Willy McDuff characters to pass through with their group.She said: ""My character didn't make any sense without the Wonka explaining who I was, that I was The Unknown, an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls.""So I was just sitting behind the mirror trying to act creepy because that was the only direction I was given.""It was definitely a mixed bag of reactions. Some people loved it, some people were terrified of it. ""But I think most people didn't really know what I was there for - which was the same for me.""Felicia said her concerns about the performance intensified just 45 minutes after the doors opened.She recalled: ""The first few runs were actually working quite well because there was order in it.""But people were straggling in and then it was just all going wrong.""In the room next to the mirror, one of the Wonkas had been in there for like an hour straight and he hadn't left and the other two Wonkas had just disappeared.""During that time more people were coming along and it would build up and build up.""I was sitting behind the mirror texting my mum saying it was going so wrong.""Felicia said each Wonka led a group of about 60 people and often they could not all fit in one room.She added: ""One of the other Wonkas made up a storyline that if the children pulled a silly face at me, I would be scared and hide back in my corner. ""That worked really well and it would kind of make sense with the plot. ""But that didn't happen every time so sometimes I just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner.""Felicia revealed she still has the costume from the event and said it was ""quite funny"" that people had been asking for it.After the experience was shut down, the actors went to the pub for a debrief.She recalled: ""When we came back it was just a big massive mob outside.""There were like four police cars outside. It was really crazy.""But despite the backlash, Felicia said the response had been positive on the whole.She added: ""At first I was really embarrassed about it. But when we went to the pub after, we were just laughing about it.""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""And now it's become viral, it's genuinely life-changing and I'm really happy I did it. ""Everybody loves the character and posting about it, so it makes me happy that people can see the funny side."" Doctor's had described Elijah, from Pontypridd, as a medical ""mystery"" and were unable to explain his constant illness prior his diagnosis.Chloe Jones, Elijah's mum and also a nurse, said he has ""never gone longer than two weeks"" without becoming ill.Elijah is now in need of a bone marrow transplant and his family are urging people to help them find a match.Chloe said she first began to piece together why Elijah had been in and out of hospital for almost 18 months, while giving him a bath. ""I noticed there were quite a few bruises going along his spine… then I noticed his mouth and his tongue and lips had all of these blood spots and they looked like blisters,"" she said. She and her partner Rhys began to consider that low levels of blood platelets - cells which help prevent bleeding - could be affecting Elijah's health.After a 10-day stay in the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, Elijah was diagnosed with genetic condition Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood cancer which affects young children.In just 12 weeks, Elijah had developed tonsillitis, croup, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, and an ear infection.""If he just had a common cold it would lead to something else, it would be sickness, he would be off his food... and then it would be something else - it was just constant,"" said Chloe.Chemotherapy is not as effective for treating Elijah's condition, as JMML is not an active cancer, lying  dormant until patients become unwell.Elijah requires a bone marrow transplant, where healthy stem cells are implanted into the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy cells.His family are now appealing for people to sign up to the stem cell register, in order to give Elijah the best chance of finding a donor match.Elijah's appeal has received the support of blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as well as a number of celebrities and sports stars.  A social media post from Chloe to update friends and family about her son's progress was shared by far and wide, including by former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp.Chloe said she and Rhys had been trying to keep Elijah's life as normal as possible, by doing a lot of outdoor activities such as walks and trips to the park, but his life has become limited.""We've taken him out of childcare, to just try and eliminate any risk of him getting any kind of illness at childcare, soft plays, anywhere like that is a 'no go' zone,"" she said. Speaking ahead of his second birthday celebrations, Chloe said it had been ""really hard"" to make any plans. ""I can't guarantee what the weather is going to be like, I can't plan anything, so no plans yet. Hopefully we can just go for a walk or to the park. As much as I love Wales it is quite tough.""Despite his health troubles, Chloe says Elijah hasn't let his condition slow him down, and that ""you wouldn't think anything was wrong if you saw him"".""Even when he was really unwell and he was in hospital he was still running up and down the corridors, going into the other children's rooms, pinching chocolates and snacks... he is definitely a little soldier."" Chloe said it had been helpful to finally have some answers for Elijah's health problems, and to have the support of parents of other children her son had been in hospital with. In an appeal for people to add their name to the stem cell register, she said: ""You don't know how much it's needed until you see it first hand and it's such a simple thing to do to donate your bone marrow.""It's absolutely life changing for those who need it and there are so many people who do need it, and there's not enough people on the register.""It's so simple to get on the register, if you're already donating blood or platelets, it's just a tick box, and if you're not, it's just a mouth swab. It's so simple, and if you get called up you're potentially saving a life.""Family struggles with cost of cancer treatment'My stress of rising costs and a child with cancer'Million pound appeal for girl with leukaemia This video can not be playedPeople living with one of the most common types of alopecia could soon have access to treatment on the NHS in Scotland for the first time.The drug - called Ritlecitinib - will go before the Scottish Medicines Consortium this week after it was approved for NHS use in England last month.Although the daily pill won’t cure the condition, it could provide treatment to some who have severe alopecia areata, like 21-year-old Megan McCready, from Clydebank.Since her diagnosis at the age of 12, Megan has learned to embrace her condition and now supports other young people going through the same thing.Video by Morgan Spence and Hazel Martin'I embrace my alopecia, but I’d love my old hair back’ Video, 00:01:39'I embrace my alopecia, but I’d love my old hair back’Up Next.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze Here, Nadiya reflects on how her childhood shaped her - ending with the words she composed for her 13-year-old. From the moment she was born, I realised I was not prepared to bring a daughter into this world who would ever think that she was less than anyone else.She is my youngest child. I have two sons as well - they are 16 and 17.I knew growing up as brown Muslim boys would be hard for them both - but they have not had to deal with the hurdles and challenges facing my daughter. There is an affirmation that I've taught them all - but especially her: ""Elbows out."" You need to make space for yourself wherever you go.Now she is a teenager, I don't want my daughter to lose the big dreams and bold ambitions that I lost as a girl.At school, in Luton in the early 1990s, I remember learning about world leaders in history. ""That's what I want to be,"" I thought. ""I'm going to become prime minister."" But then somebody would say: ""Well, have you ever seen a brown prime minister?"" And that particular dream would be squashed.It makes you think how far we have come today.As I approached the age my daughter is now, Nadiya the dreamer was disappearing. I could see that the path ahead of me was to be different to that of my brothers. There was a hierarchy in my family - and men were always at the top. My brothers had freedom, they could socialise, and they could get an education. Although I worked hard in my A-levels and wanted to go to university, my mum told me there was absolutely no way.""You're a girl, you need to get married,"" she said. I felt as though the person who once had been so lively was disappearing. But now, when I look back, I am proud of who I have become. I think my children are too.Dear Daughter: Elbows out with Nadiya HussainListen on BBC SoundsWhen I was a little girl, I never saw anyone like me on a TV cookery show. OK, I might not be prime minister, but thanks to my passion for baking, I have become a British Bangladeshi in the public eye. Baking built my confidence and helped me cope with my anxiety - I have PTSD and panic disorder. It helped me make connections with people, through the sharing of food.Maybe the big dreams of Nadiya, the little girl, weren't so unrealistic after all.Both my daughter and eldest son love baking. My second son does the dishes. My husband on the other hand is a terrible cook. Once, as he was boiling eggs, they exploded and hit the ceiling.My daughter is very smart, conscientious and kind. She rolls her eyes sometimes when I give her advice - but I know she is really listening deep down.When I sent this letter to my daughter on her phone, she asked if we could frame it and put it in her room. ""Absolutely, we'll frame it,"" I said. I never want to lose our lines of communication.This is your Ma, though when I speak, I know you do not listen. Not really. You shrug. You dismiss, you reel in disgust, as I suggest that I may know better. You look at me and all you see is your mother. The Woman, the person you have known your whole life.You see what is stood in front of you, though often bedraggled. I am here. I am your mother. That is all you see. Not the person that came before her. Let me tell you a little bit about that little girl.That girl, well, she was nothing like your mother. This girl, she was wild. She had great thoughts and even greater dreams. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She spoke about how she felt. She spoke about change. She preached about fairness. Even at her tender age. She knew where she wanted to be. Despite the blockades that life had in store for her.Sometimes I daydream and wonder where that little girl went. How did she disappear out of plain sight so fast? Then I look at you and realise you are that little girl. Same, but entirely different. Fierce, bold and bright, like your mother before you.This is your Ma. Though even when I speak, I know you do not listen. Just know that the little girl inside me that I once was, and I once lost, is holding your hand. And we won't lose another little girl ever again. Let your fire always be fierce. May your purpose guide you. Be the brightest shining light.Baking the Queen's birthday cake More than 4,500 people work at Asos's distribution centre in Grimethorpe - more than that who live in the former south Wales mining village of Maerdy.How well they've responded to losing their mine, the old village heartbeat, depends on your barometer of success.Is getting bigger better, or is it all about a tight-knit community spirit?A quarter of the Welsh population live in former coalfield communities and near the head of the Rhondda Valley in Maerdy, there's a few shops, takeaways, a pub and one road in and one road out. On a busy day, it can take almost two-and-a-half hours on public transport to get the nearest big city, so locals say people have to move away from their community to get work.Roads, railway lines and more importantly industry - or jobs  - never arrived after the pit shut in 1990, five years after miners went back to work following the miners' strike.""Lots of things were promised, but not a lot of things came to the valley,"" said Dawn Wood, who was deputy head at Maerdy Primary for 45 years, including during the strike.""That is a condemnation of any government, whether it's Labour, Conservative, every government. I cannot blame one more than the other.""Coal has been at the heart of everything in Maerdy for more than 100 years - livelihoods, the social and sporting scene. The mine was the community.When miners marched back to work at the local mine in 1985 after the strike, it was the beginning of the end for coal mining in the village.The town walked in lockstep with the miners, accompanied by a brass band, but within five years the pit was gone for good - and Dawn, now in her 60s, reckons the village's fortunes have steadily declined.""It is the lack of foresight, they promise things but they don't put it in,"" said Dawn.""So as far as I'm concerned it is not the people that have let the valleys down, it is governments that have let the valleys down.""Dawn isn't alone as a new BBC survey suggests three in five people said closing the pits had a negative impact on their area - and almost three-quarters polled said they'd seen little or no regeneration.""Shops have closed, everybody had to go out of the valley to work... It's all gone, it's not the same,"" said lifelong Maerdy resident Phil Pugh.There is also more deprivation, higher unemployment and poorer health, and new research estimates nearly 20% of people are out of work in the village deep in the Rhondda Fach Valley.""We haven't got a train, they promised a new road that was supposed to come all the way up to Maerdy, but it only came up as far as Pontygwaith,"" said Gill Owen and Trina Coombs, who join the Knit and Natter group in Maerdy every Tuesday. ""You've got one road in and one road out. Big businesses will not come up here, because of the cost of their travelling time. If there's an accident, you can't get out. ""Last year the workmens' club in Tylorstown got burnt down. We were stuck for four days.""While the last four decades haven't been kind to Maerdy, some former coalfield communities have flourished.Miners in the Yorkshire village Grimethorpe in south Yorkshire marched back to work around the same time as those in Maerdy, also accompanied by their own brass band made famous by the Ewan McGregor film Brassed Off.Grimethorpe's pit shut in 1993 - and within a year the village near Barnsley was considered the poorest in the UK with half the workforce unemployed.""Let's be blunt, the government walked away - it devastated that community and said goodbye... and in a sense everything just imploded,"" said Sir Stephen Houghton, head of the multi-agency Grimethorpe Regeneration Board.This video can not be playedThe story of the miners' strikes in Wales in 1984 and 1985""This wasn't miners losing a few jobs, they lost a whole way of life. Everything disappeared overnight. Society in the village started to break down. Crime and disorder went through the roof.""But a £100m injection built new roads, attracted industry including international fashion retailer Asos, and Grimethorpe - about halfway between Leeds and Sheffield - has grown.""We had to show the people of Grimethorpe, that somebody cared about them and would work with them, and try and find funds, to try and turn the thing around,"" added Sir Stephen, now Barnsley council leader.Grimethorpe grew - the fortunes of the village and those who lived there changed - but not everyone benefited.""The new road opened up a lot of possibilities,"" said internationally-renowned dance artist Gary Clarke, who is was born and bred in Grimethorpe.""It's also brought a lot of new people into the village. I don't want to paint a picture like it's all a bed of roses. It's definitely not. The scars still run very deep in Grimethorpe. ""You can see the division between the old community and some of the newer people that come into the village. What brings people together in Grimethorpe is the legacy of the place.""A lot of the newer people don't necessarily know the history that Grimethorpe is built on and so with that I think they don't have that community spirit. The soul of Grimethorpe's changed dramatically, but we are trying our best to bring those two sides together.""It's the opposite back in Maerdy. While some may think they have nothing, others feel having each other is everything - a community spirit that many villages yearn for.""Open your door, and there's always somebody who'd do you a favour"", says Karen Knott, enjoying a weekly catch-up at Knit and Natter.""If you were ill, they'd post you a letter, get you a pint of milk - they'd still do it now. My husband was putting an old bike in the car the other day, and somebody came along and asked if he needed any help.""The current head at the local school likens the current cost of living crisis to the strike in the 80s - and she feels it was community that got people through then, and it will be community that will get people through now.""During the strike people stood together and helped each other,"" said Maerdy primary head Helen Gregory.""Today with the financial climate that we're in, people need help as they did back then and we still have people standing side by side helping each other.""If you go out and about in Maerdy people know each other, people care about each other. There are not many jobs in Maerdy - but we're proud to live here.""Welsh miners in Ukraine to repay 1984 strike helpHow did the miners' strike affect Wales?Voices from the 1984 miners' strike They have been organised by the Memory Stones of Love group, which was set up by families wanting to remember their loved ones together.Events are taking place across the UK on Sunday to remember lives lost as part of a national day of reflection.In Londonderry bereaved families took part in a walk across the Peace Bridge.A minute's silence was then held in the city's Peace Flame Garden.Ciaran Ward's parents Bredge and Owen Ward, from Strabane, County Tyrone, died within 12 hours of each other in November 2020.""Today is a special day for all of the bereaved families to come together to grieve together to remember their loved ones,"" Mr Ward told BBC News NI.""For myself, during the pandemic to lose Mum and Dad, it feels surreal, it still doesn't feel real.""Mr Ward recalled being unable to visit his parents in hospital due to the strict measures put in place at the time to reduce transmission of the Covid-19 virus. ""Not being able to see them - everyone in life wants to be with their family as they pass away,"" he said. ""And they also want to be at home. And for us, for Mum and Dad - they were denied that.""He added: ""It's important that as a collective society that we all come together and we remember the horror that has happened and the trauma that has happened for so many people.""Catriona Myles's father Gerry McLarnon was 67 when he died during the pandemic. She recalled how her dad, who suffered from cancer, died without family members present when he was admitted to hospital in December 2020 after contracting Covid.The annual day of reflection is ""so important for the families"", she said.She said she was at Sunday's event ""to bring comfort, compassion and solidarity to other families that have faced the same losses as ourselves"". ""Everyone wants to move on and I understand that as a society we need to move on but, for the families, there are so many questions unanswered,"" she added.""And it's a very lonely place that we're in a lot of the time.""Families also attended events in Belfast and Enniskillen to remember those who died. In Belfast Memory Stones of Love organised a the craft event, from which bereaved family members planned to walk together to Belfast City Hall, which will be lit up yellow in memory of those who died.Last year the group laid more than 300 memory stones in the shape of a heart outside City Hall.The stones were individually painted and bore the name of a loved one who died in the pandemic.Other public buildings across Northern Ireland, including the Guildhall in Derry, will also be illuminated yellow on Sunday evening as a mark of respect. Covid bereaved gather to remember lost loved onesCouple dies 12 hours apart with Covid-19Politicians lack humanity, Covid daughter says ""It was mental,"" said Meg and Charlie, both 29, who live in Swansea. James gifted the couple the tickets for the show, which took place at London's O2 Arena, as an engagement present.The DJ also spent the night itself at the couple's home in Swansea, babysitting their daughter, Maisie, seven - where he got his nails painted.""Maisie absolutely loved it,"" said Meg, who's originally from Pontypridd, joking that James had a ""similar mindset of age"" to their daughter. James appeared to enjoy himself as well, posting a picture of him playing with Maisie's doll house, as well as a video of them together at the park. He also posted a list of chores Maisie had given him, which included washing the dishes with pink gloves, reading time, and salon time.A photo posted later in the night showed James with a set of pink nails. The relationship between the couple and the DJ started when Charlie appeared on a segment of James' show called What's my Age Again, and ""stupidly"" got his own age wrong. It developed from there, with both Charlie and Meg appearing on the show, both individually and together, in the last few months. They appeared again on Friday and were expecting to take part in a ""Mr and Mrs"" style quiz, which Meg said she had researched for. ""But it was a complete ploy - they told us the truth, that they wanted us to swap lives,"" she said. James said he had attended the show before, and wanted to give away his and his wife's tickets. He offered to babysit the couple's daughter, and on Saturday Meg and Charlie travelled to London where they were put up in a hotel. ""The only thing we had to worry about what was finding something to wear,"" Meg said.They said they had an ""amazing time"" at the show, with seats close to the stage, and indulged in a fair amount of celeb-spotting. They were also full of praise for James, describing him as a ""selfless"" and ""genuine person"". Meg is a maternity worker for the NHS, and Charlie a field technician for an advertising company, and the couple joked they had a ""very romantic story"" of meeting online. Meg is originally from Pontypridd and Charlie from Essex, and James has described the couple as ""a real life Gavin and Stacey"". ""To be honest, we're more like Nessa and Smithy,"" said Meg, referring to the characters played by James Corden and Ruth Jones. ""We like KFC too much."" It was a night out the television characters would likely have embraced.""We were back by 2am. We ended the night with a McDonald's - that's our kind of night,"" Meg said. Raye makes history by winning six Brit AwardsWho won what at the Brit Awards - the full listBrit Awards 2024: The real winners and losers Jo Hamilton was falsely accused of stealing £36,000 from a Post Office in South Warnborough, Hampshire. On stage at the ceremony, she called for compensation to be sped up for those wrongfully prosecuted.She was joined by the actress who played her in ITV's Mr Bates vs The Post Office, Monica Dolan.The hit drama has been credited with creating mass public interest in the scandal.Mrs Hamilton, 66, told the crowd at the O2 Arena: ""I want to thank everyone in the country for the love and the support they have given the postmasters. ""Please can you keep on supporting us because, despite what the government says, they're not paying the postmasters.""The mother-of-two was prosecuted for a shortfall of £36,000 in 2006 and was persuaded to plead guilty to a charge of false accounting.She took up a cleaning job, had to mortgage her house twice, borrowed money from friends, and received donations from the local community to pay back the funds.Her conviction was overturned in 2021 when it was discovered more than 700 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted because of a faulty accounting system.Mrs Hamilton presented the Song of the Year award to Raye for Escapism, a track which also featured the artist 070 Shake.Raye made history on the night, winning six prizes and beating Blur, Adele and Harry Styles' record four wins at a single ceremony.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Researchers at the University of Surrey taught an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict the 3D pose from a 2D image of a dog.A myriad of virtual dogs were created using the video game Grand Theft Auto.Postgraduate research student Moira Shooter said: ""From ecology to animation, this neat solution has so many possible uses.""One way to teach AI to get 3D information from 2D images is to show it photos while giving it information about 3D 'ground truth' - where the objects are in 3D space.For humans, that means wearing motion capture suits.  Unable to replicate the same with dogs, researchers altered the code of Grand Theft Auto V, switching the main character for one of eight breeds of dog - a process known as modding.They generated 118 videos of the dogs sitting, walking, barking and running in a range of different weather and lighting conditions.  The team called their new database DigiDogs, which was made up of 27,900 frames.They now plan to fine tune the system using Meta's DINOv2 model to make sure it can predict a 3D pose just as well from real dog pictures.  ""Our model was trained on CGI dogs, but we were able to use it to make 3D skeletal models from photographs of real animals,"" Ms Shooter said. ""That could let conservationists spot injured wildlife, or help artists create more realistic animals in the metaverse. She added: ""3D poses contain so much more information than 2D photographs.""Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

The HeraldThe ScotsmanDaily RecordThe Scottish SunDaily MailScottish Daily ExpressThe TimesThe TelegraphThe NationalThe CourierThe P&JGlasgow TimesEdinburgh News Wiltshire's chalk streams host a huge amount of wildlife and despite looking clear, they have been failing to meet ""good"" ecological health status. The Wylye Chalk Stream Project involves farmers, the Wessex Rivers Trust (WRT) and the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust (WWT).Alice Eley, WWT's water team manager, said: ""They [chalk streams] support very unique biodiversity.""The project, which Ms Eley said is of an ""unprecedented"" scale, has been funded by the government's Landscape Recovery scheme.Some of the wildlife supported by chalk streams and rivers in Wiltshire, such as in the Wylye Valley and Salisbury Plain, include salmon, brown trout, otters and water voles. Chalk streams come straight from the aquifer, a type of rock or sediment which holds groundwater, with the water filtered through the chalk, giving it unique features like a neutral temperature all year round.Ms Eley said the conditions helped certain plants to thrive, such as water crowfoot (Ranunculus), ""which is what these rivers are designated for,"" she added.""They [chalk streams] react very strongly to pollution. A small water quality change can have a devastating impact on chalk streams,"" Ms Eley said.Josh Stratton is one of the group of farmers in the area involved in the project - they want to return the river to it's natural course and closer to the environment that it would have enjoyed a century or two ago.On one stretch, he has put in gravel to make it shallow in parts, but also made deeper areas, as well as sections that are fast or slow-flowing.Changes like this provide a larger variety of habitats for wildlife, including improving conditions for fish spawning.""This land is almost post-agricultural so my tonnes per hectare of water voles will be increasing not my tonnes per hectare of wheat,"" explained Mr Stratton.He said he is excited about the project and pleased that the government has put in a framework, but said the science helps too: ""Having real scientists to make it work for farmers has helped. You can't expect farmers to do that in isolation.""The Wylye Chalk Stream Project is one of 34 successful schemes to come from the Landscape Recovery fund.Ms Eley said: ""Farmers are almost the lifeblood of the river - all of our rivers go through farmland. ""We want farmers to give rivers space - to grow, move, flood out, to do all the things a natural river should do.""It is not always possible because of development or good agricultural land, but where it can de done, it can benefit downstream.""

It would be the biggest ever rollout of new bathing water sites as part of the Government's plan to improve water quality across the country. ""This is a massive win for ordinary Taunton residents and users of our River Tone,"" said Mr Amos.""At last there will be proper monitoring of water quality and support and guidance for the many who swim in the river at French Weir, and recognition for something people have enjoyed as of right here for hundreds of years.""Janine Appleton added: ""I'm absolutely thrilled, as are the rest of the Friends of French Weir Park committee, at the news that we've reached the public consultation stage of our application for Bathing Water Status. ""Gideon Amos and I, along with the rest of the Friends committee, worked very hard to get this far, and the Safe Swim sessions we held last year at the river steps in French Weir Park showed just how valued our river is for both the local and wider community.""The public consultation on the proposed 27 swimming sites closes on 10 March.Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

A carpet of snowdrops at an estate which plays host to The Great British Bake Off's famous white tent have been gobbled up by an horde of slugs.Welford Park in Newbury, Berkshire, said its white blooms normally lasted about five weeks until March.But the park's team said heavy rainfall and warm temperatures had caused an epidemic of snowdrop-hungry slugs.In a message posted online, the estate warned visitors to expect to see a much-reduced number of blooms.This video can not be playedWatch: Elizabeth line passengers walk down the tracks after their hours-long waitNetwork Rail has announced a recovery plan for the Reading-London Paddington route after months of poor performance.It made national headlines when broken wires left 4,000 passengers stranded on trains for four hours at night, near Ladbroke Grove, on 7 December.Most passengers had to walk along the tracks to reach safety. There have also been a spate of failures, including broken rails and signalling faults.The route is now set to be overhauled in three phases over 18 months.Thousands of runners have taken to the streets for an annual half marathon in Berkshire.About 3,500 competitors, including elite runners, began running the Wokingham Half Marathon at 10:00 GMT.Starting and finishing at Cantley Park, the race takes participants through the town centre, although a contingency route has been put in place this year due to flooding.Organisers said the event raises more than £100,000 for charity each year.Antlers on a life-size stag sculpture were sawn off in a spate of ""wanton vandalism"", a resident has said.Clean cut marks can be seen towards the base of each antler on the monument in Savernake Park, Bracknell, suggesting they were deliberately removed.Ken Toogood, one of those to spot the damage, said those responsible must have been ""clandestine"" and it looked ""premeditated"" given the use of tools.Were it not for a nearby sign, passers-by would have no clue what once stood on a grassy spot in Berkshire.Beside an arrow pointing to a campus gym, another points to the Imperial College Reactor Centre in Ascot.While the sports building is clearly visible, all that stands in front of it now is an open field.But for almost half a century, the patch of grass - not far from Ascot's world-famous racecourse and Legoland - was home to a nuclear reactor.Now, after 10 years' work, it has become the first civil nuclear site in Britain to be fully decommissioned - the point where regulators have been able to revoke its licence and end the strict controls imposed to protect the public.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Harri Barker has helped to bring saunas to the GowerThey are more commonly spotted in the corners of gyms and luxury hotels - but saunas are starting to pop up on the Welsh coast.Swansea's Gower peninsula in winter may seem like a strange place to relax in your swimsuit, but more and more people are visiting, keen to chase away the rainy day blues.It is the Scandinavian model being followed - where people can move from the cold of the sea, quickly to the warm. The British Sauna society (BSS) was set up almost 10 years ago with a focus on bringing the authentic sauna to the UK, and said numbers have doubled, with an increasing amount outside.It believes these could potentially replace pubs and community centres which are closing - but what is the appeal?‘’It is time away from your phone, time away from the rush of everyday life,"" Harri Barker told BBC Wales Live. ""It kind of brings you back to earth a little bit.’’ She set up Ty Sawna on the Gower in 2022, with one of they reasons being its connection to nature. ‘’That is what it's all about,’’ she added.‘’It can be sunny, raining, snowing or stormy, but you just sit in the sauna and it's like a portal that takes you somewhere else.’""It’s an activity which encourages others to get outside during the winter season.  ‘’When a lot of people find it really difficult to cope over the colder months, it’s a way to get people out and meeting new people.’’Scotland’s new wild sauna culture. Video, 00:01:53Scotland’s new wild sauna cultureBoxing Day swimmers fear sewage in seaWith two saunas at Oxwich Bay, Harri is on the sands at 06:00 most mornings during the winter, stoking the fire and setting up.Regular visitors include a group of cold water swimmers, and she said the combination of the hot and cold immersion keeps people coming back.  ‘’There is no feeling quite like it,"" Harri said.‘’It's just this buzz that you get, this natural high.’’It may be cold outside, but it is relaxing inside with a sea viewSecretary of the BSS Gabrielle Reason said there is a real difference between these saunas and the ones commonly seen in the UK.    ‘’The normal ones tend to be in the corner of a gym or in a hotel,"" she said.‘’People will sit in there, they'll get hot, uncomfortable and think 'that's enough'.‘’A lot of time if you go into a badly built sauna you don’t even access the benefits.’’She explained that the Finnish and Scandinavian style involves a more cyclical approach to the activity - moving from hot to cold and repeating this for up to an hour and a half.Gabrielle said that some research suggests this traditional sauna experience could be good for our physical health.    ‘’We are doing some of the same things for our body that exercise would do,"" she added.Gabrielle added some people have suggested it is like going into a therapy room, adding: ‘’When you look at what has been happening in the UK - the closing of pubs and community centres - I think it has potential to actually start replacing those things.’’Could saunas appear in more locations around the coast?‘’I would say the biggest benefit is a reduction in blood pressure,"" said Dr Tom Cullen, an assistant professor in Applied Physiology at Coventry University.‘’It’s particularly important in a Western society, where we're typically highly stressed and often have a poor diet.‘’You also see large improvements to vascular function as well.’’He has been studying the impact of heat therapy and the health benefits it can have, but stressed it cannot replace exercise.‘’If you compare things like weight loss, which is a real goal of lots of people that exercise, for example, you're not likely to see much benefit,"" Dr Cullen added.Ryan Stephens says you can meet people from all walks of lifeRyan Stephens is the founder of sea dipping group, the Wet Bandits, who are one of the regular visitors to Ty Sawna. ‘’The conversations you end up having in the sauna tend to be really deep, meaningful and are usually focused on health and wellbeing,’’ he said.‘’You meet people from all different walks of life.''It breaks down barriers and allows people to connect at a really genuine level.''It has become a favourite hobby of Oliver Bailey’It's so different compared to going to the pub or even going for a walk in the park,"" said cold dipper Oliver Bailey.‘’It really stands out. It's just wild.’’While Ty Sawna and many other outdoor saunas are currently on the coast, the BSS sees no reason why they cannot spread to other locations.‘’We want people to see this as a health activity like going to the gym or going to a yoga lesson,’’ secretary Gabrielle said.‘’I think a lot of the saunas cropping up have attracted white, middle class people but there's definitely people who are looking to push that.’‘’There are projects looking at getting social prescribers to start recommending it as a preventative health measure.’’https://www.britishsaunasociety.org.uk/https://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/ Pen-y-Bont in Abergele, Conwy, was relaunched on St David's Day after refurbishment, with what some called a ""slapdash translation"" of its name. The Bridge Head is now displayed prominently on signs, with its Welsh-language name appearing in smaller writing below.The BBC has contacted the owners to respond.""It disparages the Welsh language... this is some kind of slapdash translation, which is unacceptable,"" said local Dylan Rhys Jones.""You have the English translation in big letters and the Welsh name in small letters underneath.""I don't see the reason why they need to change the name.""Gareth Bolton, who also lives nearby, said the decision to ""rebrand the pub"" had attracted a lot of attention from local residents on social media.He said he was in favour of empty buildings being brought back to life but not ""mindlessly changing names from Welsh to English"".He pointed to another example - Y Gwindy being changed to The Winery, adding: ""At the end of the 19th century, Abergele had 16 pubs, all of them with an English name apart from Pen-Y-Bont and the Gwindy.""The names of these institutions are woven into local culture, identity and history.""The savage act of erasing our language is atrocious.""Language use has divided opinion, with some saying that where names are similar - such as Treorci/Treorchy or Caerffili/Caerphilly - the Welsh version only could be used.Some national parks have also moved to use Welsh names only, such as Eryri and Bannau Brycheiniog - formerly known as Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons respectively.In Eryri, Llyn Tegid has sometimes been known as Lake Bala, and Llyn Bochlwyd as Lake Australia.Should some place names be written only in Welsh?Translation error directs drivers to 'town egg gas'U-turn on street signs means they will be in Welsh Carwyn Powell said he felt ""stranded"" after Spot the collie disappeared. The Pet Abduction Bill will not apply to Wales as animal welfare is a devolved matter. The Welsh government said to ensure its resources have most impact in delivering its animal welfare plan, Wales will not be included in the bill.Currently, pet theft is classed under the Theft Act, meaning that a stolen pet is treated as inanimate property under the law. The Pet Abduction Bill, brought forward by Conservative MP Anna Firth, will make it a specific offence to abduct a pet in England and Northern Ireland.Under the new legislation, anyone convicted of the offence could face a fine or a maximum of five years in prison.But as animal welfare is a devolved matter, it is up to the Senedd to bring forward similar measures in Wales.Mr Powell's Collie, Spot, went missing in December 2018.Despite an extensive search, Spot has not been seen since. Mr Powell, 58, from Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire, said losing Spot was devastating.""It's like losing a member of the family,"" he said.""When we are doing something at home, you know there's somebody missing. When a dog's been stolen, there's no closure at all on it. You don't know what's happened to her.""Mr Powell said that the law as it stands was not strong enough to tackle pet thefts.""Something needs to be done about it because people are left just stranded really. There's no assistance coming from anywhere but in England and [Northern] Ireland now, they will have a bit of assistance if this bill goes through Parliament, but in Wales, there's nothing forthcoming.""A pet theft taskforce was set up following a rise in pet thefts during the pandemic, and an abduction bill was one of its recommendations. Former Welsh Secretary and MP for South Swindon, Sir Robert Buckland, who was a member of that taskforce, said: ""The trouble with the Theft Act is that it deals with property and a lot of people think of pets as more than just property. ""We want families to enjoy the protection of the law and that's why abduction is a much better way of looking at it than treating animals as mere property.""Sir Robert called on the Welsh government to enact a similar change, and said pet owners in Wales ""should not be put in a different position"" to those in other parts of the UK.Debbie Matthews, co-founder of the Stolen and Missing Pets Alliance, which began calling for reforms to the law a decade ago, said: ""It must be terribly worrying for the people in Wales.""I know Scotland are putting through a dog theft law, if Wales aren't, does that mean that Wales is going to become the hotspot for taking dogs and cats?""RSPCA Cymru is concerned that pets in Wales could be targeted more in other parts of the UK. Billie-Jade Thomas of RSPCA Cymru said: ""We hope that the Welsh government will continue to monitor the situation and that the decision that they have made is the result of an evidence-based approach.""RSPCA Cymru recommends the following measures for owners to safeguard their pets: A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We want all animals to have a good quality life. We are delivering this through our programme of ambitious reforms set out in our animal welfare plan. ""Our focus is on areas which will bring greatest benefit to animal welfare across Wales, including our current consultation on licensing animal welfare establishments, exhibits and activities.   ""To ensure our resources have the maximum impact on animal welfare, Wales won't be included in the scope of the Pet Abductions Bill"".More on Politics Wales on BBC One Wales, Sunday, 10:00 GMT, and on iPlayerCat and dog theft set to be made criminal offenceMen who bred puppies in sheds in £300k ring jailedPolice use DNA profiling to stop dog thefts Bedford Borough Council said six buildings have now been repaired along the High Street where new paving was unveiled in 2021.The High Street Heritage Action Zone (HSHAZ) Programme began four years ago.Vincent Decamps, from Maison Le Vôtre, said he chose Bedford over St Albans as the place to open his patisserie and bakery because of the restorative work.He said the renovations to the High Street and Silver Street, where he is based, brought ""uniformity"" and marked a ""new start for Bedford"".When looking for a location ""the first goal was to go to St Albans"", he said, and when he first looked around Bedford it was ""a no, no"".""The only thing that attracted me to this position was the renovation of the building itself; if it was not restored I would have gone to St Albans, period, simple as that,"" he said.He said he ""took a massive risk"" and the area was now welcoming customers ""who haven't been in Bedford for two, three, four, five and six years"".The restoration programme, which started in January 2020, was a joint project between the council and Historic England, in partnership with Bedford BID and SEMLEP, and had been ""instrumental in preserving and enhancing the historic fabric of Bedford's town centre"", the council said. Two new businesses had moved into ""units that have been long term vacant"", the authority added.A new display celebrating its completion and featuring photographs, artwork, and information about the evolution of the town's High Street has opened at The Higgins Bedford - and runs until 1 April.Bedford's Evolving High Street exhibition ""offers a fascinating journey through the decades, showcasing the transformation and vitality of our beloved High Street"", the council said.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said ahead of the 6 March announcement that there was ""too much waste in the system"".As part of the reforms, AI will be used to cut NHS scan times by a third and the police will deploy drones to incidents such as traffic collisions.Labour said the package amounted to ""spin without substance"".Elsewhere, Mr Hunt also hinted that civil service staff numbers could be cuts by tens of thousands. The Treasury is hoping that the proposed technological reforms will deliver as much as £1.8bn worth of benefits to public sector productivity by 2029.""There is too much waste in the system and we want public servants to get back to doing what matters most: teaching our children, keeping us safe and treating us when we're sick,"" Mr Hunt said.""That's why our plan is about reaping the rewards of productivity, from faster access to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for patients to hundreds of thousands of police hours freed up to attend burglaries or incidents of domestic abuse.""The announcement comes as Mr Hunt is under mounting pressure from his Conservative colleagues to deliver tax cuts when he unveils his Budget on Wednesday.The Treasury said the latest move would mean 130,000 patients a year - including those waiting for cancer results - would receive their completed tests quicker as a result of at least 100 MRI scanners in England being upgraded with AI.In policing, it said the reforms would help to deliver on the Police Productivity Review, which it said found up to 38 million hours of officer time could be saved every year.Other key measures in the £800m investment include:Darren Jones, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Nothing in Britain is better off after 14 years of Conservative economic failure.""Millions of people are stuck on hospital waiting lists, our schools are crumbling and our streets are less safe. And yet all the chancellor is offering is more spin without substance.""The BBC's Faisal Islam said the Budget came at a time when the government was hoping to have scope to unveil voter-friendly tax cuts ahead of the general election.It initially hoped for ""headroom"" of about £30bn to spend at the start of the year after its borrowing costs fell sharply, but the BBC understands this figure returned to its November level of roughly £13bn by the middle of last month. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Hunt acknowledged the latest forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility had broadly ""gone against us"". ""So it's going to be a Budget where we stress... the importance of being responsible with the country's finances, because it's fundamentally unconservative to fund all the things that you would like to do by borrowing money for future generations,"" he said. Paul Jonson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC that any tax cut in the Budget was ""likely to be undone after the next election, whoever wins"". He added: ""Whatever the scale of the tax cut announced this week, during this parliament taxes will have risen very substantially indeed.""Mr Hunt also said the government would look to further cut public sector costs by reducing the number of staff in the civil service back to pre-pandemic levels.According to the Institute for Government, staff levels rose from around 423,000 at the start of 2020 to 496,150 in September last year.""You had a huge expansion of [the] civil service during the pandemic that was justified,"" the chancellor said. ""It was an exceptional situation, but we're not in a pandemic now.""Faisal Islam: Why this won't be the Budget that Jeremy Hunt wantedTories need a Budget bounce but can Hunt deliver?When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?UK recession may already be over, says Bank bossFaisal Islam: Should we care that the UK is in recession?

Curator Fiona Jenkinson said: ""The Georgian period was a time of great agricultural and industrial change, dominated by class, culture and consumerism. ""Fashion, society, and leisure were key to people like John Courtney, who travelled extensively around England and took part in much of the social life of Beverley, York and London,"" she said.""He also spent much time searching for a suitable wife, and his diary is full of accounts of unrequited love, giving us an insight into romance and courting during that time,"" she added.Reproductions from William Hogarth's moralistic art series will also be on display.Councillor Nick Coultish, East Riding of Yorkshire Council's Cabinet member for culture, leisure and tourism, added: ""This will be a fascinating exhibition, and promises to be a revelation about the Georgian period in Beverley.The exhibition runs until 28 June.Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

Marco Longhi, a Conservative MP who represents Dudley North in the West Midlands, defended him and said he should not have been suspended from the party. He said there was no evidence his friend was Islamophobic or racist and that he should be re-instated.The Ashfield MP was suspended from the Tory party after he refused to apologise for the remarks, which the prime minister's official spokesperson said were wrong. Mr Longhi told Politics Midlands: ""I think where there might be a slight weakness in his argument is making an assertion that Sadiq Khan is closely associated to Islamist and therefore, by inference, an Islamist himself.""I think it's right that Lee works this out and I would like to see him return in the Conservative fold as soon as possible."" Lee Anderson has represented Ashfield since 2019Mr Longhi made the remarks during a debate about so-called no-go zones.Another Conservative MP, Paul Scully, apologised last week for suggesting there were ""no-go"" areas in parts of London's Tower Hamlets and Sparkill in Birmingham. The Dudley North MP said those comments were wrong but it did not show the Conservatives were out of touch. Mr Longhi said he represented a diverse community and there was not a corner of the United Kingdom he would personally describe as a no-go zone. ""We know that Britain's diversity is a great strength,"" added Mary Creagh, former MP for Wakefield, and Labour Party candidate for Coventry East. ""We can see good people trying to paper in the cracks that have been left by 14 years of Tory austerity and cuts to public services.""

Mr Hunt is under pressure from some Tory MPs to reduce taxes in Wednesday's Budget, ahead of an election which must be held by the end of January. A further cut to National Insurance is believed to be among the measures being considered by the chancellor.In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Hunt said the Budget, when the government sets out its plans for tax and spending, would be about ""long-term growth"". He said he also hoped to ""show a path"" towards a lower-tax economy. ""We've been very consistent, that we would only cut taxes in a way that was responsible and prudent,"" he said. ""The most unconservative thing I could do would be to cut taxes by increasing borrowing.""Overall the amount of tax people pay is still on course to reach record levels, despite the main rate of National Insurance being cut from 12% to 10% in last year's Autumn Statement. Mr Hunt has repeatedly hinted that he wants to reduce taxes further in the Budget but in recent weeks he has suggested there is likely to be less scope for this than he had hoped.  With only 72 hours until the Budget, Mr Hunt was firmly in the damping down expectations mode.At the start of this year, the government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had estimated the chancellor had about £30bn of ""headroom"" to spend in the Budget, after borrowing costs fell sharply.Since then, borrowing costs have begun to rise again and by the middle of last month, the BBC understands the figure was back to its November level of roughly £13bn.With the government's spending rules and the OBR breathing down his neck on one side, and the Tory backbenches who want the historically high taxes cut, it is not a comfortable position. However, there is wide expectation at Westminster that he will reduce some taxes, even if the moves are not significant. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said: ""The chancellor says he wants to cut taxes, but it is the Tories who have raised taxes to their highest level in 70 years. ""No matter what the chancellor does in the Budget this week, working people will be worse off thanks to 14 years of Tory failure.""Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, told the BBC that any tax cut in the Budget was ""likely to be undone after the next election, whoever wins"".The IFS has also warned that further reducing taxes is likely to mean spending cuts in the future.Asked if the government should be spending more on public services, rather than tax cuts, Mr Hunt said: ""I think what most people want is better public services and a lower tax burden.""The only way that we have a chance of delivering something like that is by spending the money that we spend on public services much more efficiently.""  The government has already announced an £800m package of reforms aimed at freeing up NHS and police time, for example using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to cut NHS scan times and drones to assess incidents such as traffic collisions.Former chief economist at the Bank of England Andy Haldane told the programme he thought the government's self-imposed spending limits - known as ""fiscal rules"" - were ""stunting"" economic growth and constraining the chancellor's decisions.These include getting debt as a proportion of the size of the economy falling in five years. Mr Hunt said he did not agree the government should change its fiscal rules because ""people would interpret that as Britain losing control of its finances"". Recent memories of the meltdown in the financial markets following Liz Truss's mini-Budget in 2022 - which included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - are a reminder of why such rules exist. But there does seem to be growing disquiet that the system that is meant to guarantee stability can have a negative impact too. Meanwhile, the chancellor is also considering other measures to raise revenue, including a new tax on vapes and scrapping non-dom tax status. People with non-domiciled status are UK residents whose home for tax purposes is abroad. Under the current system, they do not have to pay UK tax on money they make overseas.Mr Hunt has previously defended the tax status, arguing it helps make the UK an attractive place for well-off people to live and work. Labour has pledged to abolish non-dom status and spend the money generated on schools and the NHS. If the party backs any tax cuts the chancellor announces, which they are expected to do, this would leave questions over how some of their spending pledges would be funded.Mr Hunt refused to comment on any potential changes to specific taxes.However, he told the BBC: ""The country sees through gimmicks and we are not going to do gimmicks on Wednesday.""Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

Three Kent pits - Snowdown, Tilmanstone and Betteshanger - were in operation in 1984 when the 54-week dispute began.Protests were held against plans by the National Coal Board, supported by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to shut 20 ""unprofitable"" pits nationwide.The National Union of Miners' strike saw miners and police clash on the picket lines across the country.Eventually the Kent miners returned to work but the pits were destined for closure. Betteshanger was the last to close in Kent in 1989.Shaun Parry started working at Snowdown Colliery near Aylesham when he was just 16 years old. He said: ""It was 940m deep, and it was very, very hot. I think the nickname was Dante's inferno. I loved it.""Mr Parry said he had been detained by police during the strike. ""I hadn't done anything. I was taken to the van and then they cable-tied you to a wire inside the van,"" he said.""I was frightened. I was really frightened."" Kay Sutcliffe was married to miner Philip Sutcliffe and they lived in the pit village of Aylesham. She said no-one in the village broke the strike and everyone in Aylesham was ""organised and united"".For Mrs Sutcliffe, the strikes were a battle to save not just jobs, but a way of life. After seeing TV reports of miners' wives in Nottinghamshire calling for a return to work, women in Kent, led by Mrs Sutcliffe and others, travelled north to boost support for the stoppage.She penned poems which galvanized dozens of women to march in protest, while her speeches were heard by thousands. Mrs Sutcliffe said: ""I think we were the first women support group that actually publicly were noticed for doing an active thing like that.""'How is it gonna affect the miners in our community? How is it gonna affect their families if they can't get a job anywhere?' That's the kind of thing I was talking about,"" she told BBC Politics South East. ""And how much it meant to our communities to keep the pits going, and not just to our communities, but to the whole country."" Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

The Alverstoke sea defences, in the pipeline since 2015, would see the flood risk reduced for 142 homes and businesses. Seafield was also highlighted as one of the three priority areas for a flood defence scheme with 80 homes and businesses at risk, but it has an £800,000 funding gap.Council leader Peter Chegwyn said he wanted the government to provide extra money.Coastal Partners was formed in 2012 to deliver a coastal management service across the coastlines of the local authorities in Havant, Portsmouth, Gosport, Chichester, and Fareham.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Jersey Post said the stamps capture the ""enduring spirit of the RNLI"".A lifeboat was first established in Jersey in 1830, with a volunteer team and a boat, kept near Havre des Pas. In 1884, the RNLI station in St. Helier was built at Albert Quay, where it still serves as the Island's RNLI headquarters. Images chosen for the Jersey stamps include St Heliers Tamar class lifeboat, the dramatic scenes of the rescue of the yacht Fanny and Sir William Hillary, who founded the RNLI in 1824.Jersey Post said the stamps were a tribute to the ""generations of courageous volunteers and the generosity of those who give to support their vital life-saving work"".The release includes a booklet featuring further information about Jersey RNLI.The stamps will be available to buy from all branches of Jersey Post from 4 March.

Having spent the past five years on the idea, he said support for the project has now gathered. Mr Martyn cofounded the Connect 3 Million campaign, external to build the sub-seabed link in 2019, and the group has been lobbying decision-makers and politicians since.The Faroe Islands to the north of Scotland have a population of about 53,000 and spent hundreds of millions of pounds on a subsea tunnel network.A rail tunnel between Guernsey and France via Jersey would cost an estimated £5.6bn and take up to 10 years to build, according to the campaign group. Mr Dorey said making it easier for people to reach the Channel Islands would ""transform the future for everyone"". ""Our economies are strong but are being held back when we all need them to expand further. ""This innovation will herald a boom across financial services, tourism and beyond”.The roadshows are being held on 5 March in Jersey and 6 March in Guernsey.  Speakers due to attend the roadshows include tunnelling experts Arild Sovik, network director of the Norwegian Tunnelling Society and Teitur Samuelsen, chief executive of the Faroe Islands’ public company.Connect 3 Million said the speakers will share  how the economic, social and cultural benefits the tunnels have brought to the Faroe Islands, can be replicated for the Channel Islands.

He added: ""One thing I've realised is that the more authentic you are with how you feel about subjects like the Knife Angel - putting knives down and making people aware of the violence that goes on in their city - it makes people want to be more authentic themselves.""When I started, I thought people were going to think certain things about me. But I think it's down to your perception and how you view life.""If I think that, I come from a more authentic place with my music.""The album was inspired by the Knife Angel project in Gloucester - a statue made of knives that young people had surrendered. The group made the music for the launch of the sculpture last year, and then went on to make the album.Mikel Medley, youth support manager for The Music Works, said it had been ""life-changing"" for the participants.""Some of them have said they wouldn't know where they would be in their life if they wasn't doing music,"" he said. ""They probably would have got themselves into trouble or not be in a good well-being space.""Coby, who does marketing for the project, said: ""To me, it was really important just because I got to convey a lot of the stuff that isn't spoken about so much.

Teenagers in Worcestershire told the BBC Politics Midlands programme that home study during lockdown, and increased stress, had left many struggling to cope with school routine.The council said it continued to work to support pupils and parents and ""remove any barriers"" preventing attendance.Overall attendance in the autumn had been up on last year, the authority added.At Baxter College in Kidderminster, where there are 900 students, the overall attendance rate remains 4% down on pre-pandemic levels, according to the principal.One pupil there said students were struggling to readjust after the absence enforced by Covid, with one day off easily stretching into more now things were back to normal.  “At the start of the week people say ‘oh I’ll just miss the one day’,"" explained Tom, 18, a sixth form student.""And then we get to Friday and people are like ‘I’ll have a long weekend'.”Tom said he believed home study during lockdowns made many unused to school routine. “Now suddenly everyone’s being told what to do, when you can eat, when you can go home - it’s definitely been a shock,"" he told the programme.Fellow student Katie, 17, added: “School got re-introduced and I felt like people couldn’t be bothered to come back in, because they felt 'if I can do this at home, surely there’s no need'.”Another 17-year-old, Tegan, said: “My attendance has definitely dropped. I feel like I personally don’t mind working from home, and I work better in the evenings."" The number of pupils persistently absent from school in Worcestershire has not returned to pre-pandemic levelsPrincipal Mat Carpenter said the drop-off was more marked in students on free school meals.Attendance was “not just a school problem"", he said, but a matter for support services and parents too. Additionally, the number of pupils missing more than half of school has risen sharply at Baxter College.“Where previously we would have one or two [pupils like that] in the whole school… we’re now looking at up to 6%,” Mr Carpenter said.Baxter College is not unique in the county. With a secondary school population of more than 36,000, an estimated 23.9% - 8,650 students - in Worcestershire have missed at least 10% of school days so far this academic year. Baxter's principal, Mat Carpenter, and the school's wellbeing lead, Stacey Hannan, said schools needed more support to raise attendanceBaxter’s wellbeing lead Stacey Hannan - who is leading efforts to build relationships with families - admitted progress could be slow.“It could take six to eight weeks of home visits, telephone conversations with parents, and meetings,” she explained.She said the long referral waits students faced for mental health support or neurodiversity assessments meant that often schools were limited in the help they could give.“I think the system in both of those areas is creaking”, added Mr Carpenter, calling for substantial investment.Keira, 15, praised the pastoral care offered at Kidderminster & District Youth Trust, and said she did not feel like she was being judged as in schoolFor 15-year-old Keira, who is not currently in mainstream education, “mental health is the main issue"" for being an absentee, along with a lack of support for such challenges.“I started to not go in as often… my mum kept pulling me out because of how bad I was getting,"" she said of her experience.After being referred to Kidderminster & District Youth Trust, she now has a weekly meeting with mentor Maisie Cook, who says she offers an ""open space"" for teenagers to talk about their emotions and education. Speaking generally, Ms Cook said: ""We see a lot of young people who have a lot going on behind closed doors.

Kent Wildlife Trust said the mix of longhorns and Sussex cows were welcomed to Scotney Castle, near Tunbridge Wells, on Thursday to create a ""wilder, more biodiverse"" area.Rebecca Rees, the castle's manager, said they were ""thrilled"" to be working with the trust on the initiative.Castle archives show the first Scotney herd was introduced in 1896.The trust said the grounds of the 14th-century castle and Victorian country mansion included a large, wooded estate where the cattle will work alongside an existing flock of sheep to enhance the National Trust's wilder grazing plans for the site.Ms Rees said: ""The diverse features of the 780-acre estate at Scotney makes it a haven for wildlife and our ambition is to help it thrive.""She added conservation grazing on the SSSI (site of special scientific interest) will result in an increase of habitat that supports the native wildlife of Kent. ""It also continues the heritage of traditional breeds as part of a working estate,"" she added.Alison Ruyter, area manager for Kent Wildlife Trust, said the cattle have an ""exceptional ability"" to clear reeds, willow, young scrub, and bramble.""They are renowned for their calm temperament and work together to look out for each other, even taking it in turns to look after the calves whilst others sleep and forage,"" she said.Kent Wildlife Trust has more than 800 cattle, sheep, ponies, pigs, and a herd of bison across many of the 90 nature reserves under their management as part of its Wilder Grazing Strategy.Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

It also comes at a time when passengers have faced disruption to services due to strikes by rail workers over the past 18 months.Traditionally, fares are hiked based on July's retail prices index measure of inflation, which in 2023 was 9%, plus an additional 1%.However, the increase in fares has been capped below this rate, and is lower than last year.Regulated fares cover about 45% of fares, including season tickets on most commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities.For example, if the 4.9% increase is applied, an annual season ticket from Brighton to London would jump £275 to £5,891, while one from York to Leeds would go up £135 to £2,899. While some people may have tried to buy their season tickets just before the price rise, here are five tips for getting the cheapest deals at any time of the year.Advance train tickets are usually released up to 12 weeks before your departure date, although some go on sale as far as 24 weeks in advance. These types of tickets are often the cheapest way to travel on the railways if you're happy to go during a fixed time. Sometimes they can be available to buy up to an hour before your journey.Personal finance website Money Saving Expert says that London North Eastern Railway (LNER) often releases advance tickets up to six months ahead for routes from stations north of York to London.Some ticket purchasing apps can send alerts to your phone as soon as tickets for a specified journey go on sale. Split ticketing means you can take the same number of trains you normally would for your journey, but can save money by splitting your journey into multiple tickets between the stations the service stops at on the way.Some websites like Split My Fare and Split Train Tickets do it for you without you having to work it out.Split My Fare says on average, customers save 26% by doing this - although it's not always possible on some journeys. Also, checking to see whether it is cheaper to buy two single tickets rather than a return might save you money.  Rail cards can offer discounts when booking, though they cost money to purchase in the first place, so benefit those who travel often.There are several types of rail card available: national, regional, those for students and those for pensioners. For example, the 16-25 Railcard costs £30, is valid for one year and gives you one third off each ticket you buy.More information on the different types of railcard are here.You can get up to a third off the ticket price when travelling in groups of three to nine adults off-peak.The group must be travelling together, and individual rail cards cannot be used when booking a group ticket. Groups of over 10 people can also get discounts - contact the train company directly for those. Group off-peak day travelcards for London are also available, but the origin station on the ticket needs to be in fare zones one to nine.National flexible rail tickets could save passengers hundreds of pounds, says watchdog Transport Focus. The flexible season tickets will allow travel on any eight days in a 28-day period, with no need to select the days of travel in advance. Train companies have also introduced a range of flexible tickets aimed at commuters and workers who have seen their travel patterns change post-pandemic.  The Flexi Season ticket will offer a minimum of 20% discount on an equivalent monthly season ticket, according to National Rail.For those making the same journey multiple times in a week regularly, monthly or season tickets can be cheaper. Check with your employer to see if they offer a season ticket loan to help you spread the cost, interest free.Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

Planning permission was granted in 2022 for offices and a café on the neighbouring site of the historic Western Park Open Air School, which fell into disrepair after becoming the target of vandals and arsonists in the 17 years since it closed.That plan was met with a number of objections from the local community.Key concerns about the latest plan include the loss of park land, the loss of the car park, traffic and parking concerns and the harm to wildlife.A handful of supporting comments were also submitted, with those in favour saying it was good the council was doing this on brownfield land and it would help tackle anti-social behaviour to which some said the car park is ""prone"".Planning officers say the proposal has an ""exemplary and innovative design which should be welcomed"" and the new homes would help meet housing needs.In order to create space for the new homes, the Constance Jackson Centre, Parkfield and Club House buildings would be demolished, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Planning officers labelled the loss of the car park ""regrettable"" when it comes to the convenience of park users.

All 340 people on board lost their lives.The aircraft came down just minutes after take-off from Paris at 12:35 GMT and scythed a mile-long trail through the forest of Ermenonville near the French capital.Among the victims were 200 passengers, many of them British, who had been transferred from British Airways flights cancelled because of a strike by engineers at London airport.""They are very much part of the fabric of our club,"" said Mr Germeney.""It is important that we remember the 50-year anniversary. What happened devastated the club and the rugby world generally.""Club secretary Andy Herlihy added: ""What happened left a massive hole in the club across all our teams for many years.""The club has this season changed its colours in tribute to the victims of the 1974 disaster.Players are wearing black shirts, embossed with the names of those who died, instead of their normal yellow and green shirt.Victims will also be remembered at events staged before Bury's next home game - against Dorking - on 9 March.One, businessman Laurie Cornish, 39, a former Grenadier Guard who lived in Pakenham, Suffolk, had travelled with the Bury party after being given a ticket for the France-England game by a friend.His son Austin Cornish, 53, of Buxhall, Suffolk, said he would lay wreaths with relatives privately on Sunday.He is also planning a charity cycle ride in September, starting from the area where the aircraft crashed to Bury St Edmunds, in tribute to the victims.Mr Cornish took part in a similar ride to mark the 40th anniversary.""My dad didn't play rugby for Bury but the club was part of the social life of the town,"" said Mr Cornish.""They had gone to watch England play France and someone had given him a ticket.""He added: ""I don't remember the crash and don't have any memory of my dad.""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

The conservation work began in 2022, which meant one side of the cathedral was hidden by scaffolding. Now it has been taken down and visitors have full access to the garden overlooking the River Wear.The expert team removed stones in bad condition and carved new stones to make them the right shape and size, before securing them into the wall with lime mortar.The Monks' Garden became enclosed when the Galilee Chapel was built in the 12th Century and was used by novice monks in their leisure time.After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th Century, the bowling green became a garden for the clergy.Gary Holliday, stonemason supervisor, said: ""Although it has been a challenging and lengthy process, working in all weather, the most satisfying parts of the project have been in the workshop cutting stones to our templates. ""Once we completed these we carefully moved them on to the site and fixed them in place.

""Some daft immaturity came over me and I was a bit unsure, as I took my seat next to Dave Myers, the lad with alopecia. ""He was completely welcoming and friendly, and we hit it off with a shared passion for art.""Here began the lifelong friendship that took us to flat sharing in London to pursue our fine art degrees and all the adventures ahead.""After school, the pair ended up as flatmates in Peckham, London. When they would travel back to Barrow to visit family and friends, Mr Twyford recalls Myers and Peter Thompson going to the market for fresh food and cooking up a feast for them all. ""Dave and Pete would cook for us until the early hours of the morning, all adventurous dishes,"" he said.""He was very loveable, full of enthusiasm, the same off-screen as on-screen. ""I loved Dave, he always had some adventurous plan he was going to try.""He was just full of enthusiasm and a zest for life.""His favourite memory from their enduring friendship was going to Brixton to a big motorbike warehouse and Myers buying his first ever bike.However, he did not have a licence and Graham had to drive it, with Myers in the sidecar. When Myers got his licence, the pals went on trips back to Cumbria from London.Graham said: ""I remember it was a Cossack Ural 650cc with a sidecar.""The picture was taken on an early trip up to the Lakes from London in 1978.""We took it in turns to ride the bike with one helmet between us.""Cumbria is one of the top culinary destinations outside London, with a total of 16 Michelin Stars across 13 restaurants.Simon Rogan runs L'Enclume restaurant in Cartmel, south Cumbria, which has three stars.He said Myers was a great ambassador for the county and helped grow its culinary reputation. ""He was always shouting from the rooftops about the produce and the people and he had a genuine love for the area,"" Mr Rogan said.""I think he was proud of the restaurant scene and what was going on in the North West, predominantly in Cumbria.""Myers also lived in Roa Island for many years.It is just over half a mile (1 km) south of the village of Rampside, at the southern most point of the Furness Peninsula in Westmorland and Furness and has a population of about 100.It is a tight-knit community and friends and neighbours are saddened by his loss, but remember the TV personality fondly.Former neighbour, Ian Honeyman said: ""It's sad news, I knew he'd been ill but I didn't realise it was as serious as that. ""We were both born in Devon Street and we used to joke about which part of the street did we come from, was it the rough end, that kind of thing.""He never forgot Cumbria and I think he did such marvellous work publicising it, which was great.""He was a real natural comic and such a lovely guy.""Even those who did not know him personally were struck by his natural warmth and down to earth nature when they met him in the flesh.During a trip to Glenridding in the Lake District a couple of years ago, Olivia Clarke spotted two big motorbikes in a car park and her hopes were raised that they might belong to her two biking and cooking heroes. She said: ""We had a couple of minutes chat. They weren't filming, they were just on a boys' jolly, having lunch."" Ms Clarke said her overriding memory of the encounter was the pair's chemistry.""It just stuck with me because their energy, even off-screen, was there, this was well before Dave was ill,"" she said.""He had this smiley face, this look on him, this swagger and you just knew you could talk to him."" She said Myers' and King's connection was ""spectacular"".""They didn't just turn the magic on, it was real and they actually finished each other's sentences, like an old married couple or a pair of comfy shoes.""Malcolm Flynn, who was another one of chef's neighbours when he lived on Roa Island, said he regularly took photographs of the town and sent them to Myers.He said: ""I'd often walked round the park or go on the bridge and take shots for Dave and send them to him. ""If you saw him he would always stop and speak, he always had the time and was always cheerful.""He was a true Barrovian and we will miss him.""Follow BBC Cumbria on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

The hearing, which was held between between 21 and 23 February, considered incidents from between 2018 and 2020.Simeon Wallis presented the Nursing and Midwifery Council's case, saying Mr Ainsworth's dishonesty was ""not limited to a single occasion"".Mr Wallis said the former director's actions were serious and effectively an attempt to evade responsibility for situations in which a direct risk of harm to patients had been created by an error of his judgement, even though no harm materialised.The panel said in January 2019 Mr Ainsworth failed to refer a child with sepsis, referred to as Patient A, instead providing the wrong information to the patient's mother and sent them to a pharmacy.Mr Ainsworth did not make a record of the conversation, and falsely reported that Patient's A's rash ""did fade"" and that the patient's mother declined a review, the panel added.In September 2019, the panel said Mr Ainsworth incorrectly interpreted the blood test results of another patient, asking them to attend a repeat blood test ""when they should have been asked to go to A&E immediately"".The trust issued a statement to confirm Mr Ainsworth had resigned from his role as director of strategy and partnerships, saying he ""leaves with our best wishes and we thank him for all that he achieved during his time with the trust"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

64k,25,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help. ""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk. ""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life. ""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people. ""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway. ""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really.

""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke. ""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims. ""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said. ""It can leave us unable to be the same person. It is quite devastating.

""What he achieved in 33 years, most of us never achieve in 70,"" he said.He says it was important the research got publicised and medical professionals and families see and learn from it.For one family, Karina and Terry Fay, from Essex, screening discovered one of their twins, Matilda, had Noonan syndrome. ""We were told our daughter would never be able to eat solid food, she may be able to walk, but it would be very delayed, and she wouldn't be able to have a normal child's lifestyle,"" said Karina. ""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals. ""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care. ""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.

""On Sunday they took part in a minute's silence at Pollok Country Park for those who died during the pandemic.I remember: Scotland's Covid Memorial was created in the park in 2022 following a campaign by The Herald newspaper.The £250,000 tribute, which is made up of 40 tree supports, was designed by artist and poet Alec Finlay.The structures are designed to mimic a person supporting a tree, to demonstrate the support shown in communities during the global health crisis.Sunday's events include a candlelit vigil at the entrance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, organised by Scottish Covid Bereaved.Ms Devine said the sisters raised the alarm when they couldn't get their mother on the phone and called round to her house.She said: ""They said her temperature was fine and took her to the Royal Infirmary just to check her over. ""But just over an hour later, they were told the mother-of-three was in a critical condition. ""It was end of life, they couldn't save her,"" said Ms McCarron. ""That's how quick it was for everybody. ""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out. ""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants. ""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning. ""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body. ""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there. ""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point. ""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through. ""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us. ""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes. ""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own. ""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures. She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends. ""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something. ""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said. ""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show. ""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"". ""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache. ""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free. ""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed. ""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award. ""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you. ""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music. ""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock! ""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle. ""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close. ""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano. ""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit. ""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing]. '""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began. ""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air. ""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it. ""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings. ""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song. ""'So what? ', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time. ""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary. ""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark. ""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said. ""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point. ""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss. ""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said. ""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be. ""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling. ""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.

Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site.

The special magic Lagos number is 7565478 ""Les Flack, another member of the group, was worried about what the closure would mean for his wife, who has COPD: ""They're there all the time, the pulmonary team, so she goes there for assessments, blood tests, any specialist stuff. ""One of the people who stopped to ask questions and complete a survey was Caroline Cooper, who said: ""I have a 94-year-old mother who uses the phlebotomy department and I have grandchildren who will use these facilities in the future"".John Whittingdale, who is the local Conservative MP, believes keeping services local is more important than saving the building.He said: ""We've been talking about a new hospital for many years. ""I deeply regret it hasn't happened but maybe this is an opportunity to actually get that new provision in the town. ""The ICB said: ""The proposals set out a clear commitment to make sure services at St Peter's Hospital such as blood testing and a majority of out patient appointments, stay local. ""We encourage people to share their views. ""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

""Ms Heslop, who was 41 when she vanished, is known to have left Mr Bane's boat moored off St John - which was under a 22:00 local time Covid curfew - to visit a bar and have dinner on 7 March.After three years without answers, Ms Street, of Ongar, Essex, says she feels ""let down"" by police on the Caribbean tourist hotspot and ""hatred"" for Mr Bane, whom she accuses of not doing enough to help find her daughter. ""I want to bring her home so I know where she is - she deserves that. ""The family now has an investigator, a former Metropolitan Police commander of homicide and serious crime, helping them look into the case.Ms Street, who has previously travelled to the island as part of the search for her daughter, told the paper: ""There's too many things that don't make sense and don't add up. ""She is calling on Mr Bane to provide the police with everything he knows about her daughter's disappearance.Under US law, Mr Bane - the last person known to have seen Miss Heslop and described as a ""person of interest"" by police - can stay silent and officers must show ""probable cause"" to get a search warrant.His lawyer, David Cattie, said in a statement to the newspaper that his client was ""heartbroken"" over Ms Heslop's disappearance. ""We certainly understand and empathise with her mother's pain and frustration. ""Mr Bane called 911 immediately upon waking and finding Sarm was not on board. ""He took his dinghy to shore to meet with Virgin Islands Police Department that night and called the US Coast Guard (USCG) the next day when no-one appeared at his boat. He also had the USCG on his vessel twice following Sarm's disappearance. ""Later Mr Bane and I personally took all of Sarm's belongings to the police, including all of her electronic devices.

""Mr Keating, now 76, had spent a year on the frontline of one of the longest and most acrimonious industrial disputes in the country's history. He was among the first men to walk out on strike in March 1984 after learning of the government's plans to shut Cortonwood colliery, near Rotherham, and 19 other pits - some within weeks.More than 140,000 other miners across Britain soon joined them in downing tools. Many went unpaid for 12 months as the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), led by Arthur Scargill, fought to stop a colliery closure programme backed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.During that year, families struggled to afford food, clothe their children and heat their homes. They relied on community donations to survive, with miners' wives running soup kitchens, collecting money and food, and rallying support. ""There was a lot of heartache,"" said ex-miner Terry Cadwallander, whose brother took his own life while on strike. ""But we still had to keep going. ""For those involved, memories of the strike - and the pit closures which followed the union's defeat - remain raw 40 years on.In new interviews with the BBC, former miners, family members, police, journalists and politicians tell the story of the battle which changed Britain and its coalfield communities forever.Warning: contains strong languageIn March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) announced plans to shut 20 pits - which it said were unprofitable - with the loss of at least 20,000 jobs. Workers at Cortonwood colliery in Brampton Bierlow - earmarked to close within weeks - walked out on strike, followed by miners across Yorkshire and other parts of England, Scotland and Wales.As the strike stretched from weeks into months, mining families counted the cost of going unpaid.Miners' families relied on donations from their communities to survive. Wives ran soup kitchens, collected food and money, and held rallies to drum up support.The NUM sent protesters - known as flying pickets - to disrupt and pressure working miners. While most picket lines were relatively peaceful,violence flared between striking miners and police as tensions grew. Officers were drafted in from across the country in a coordinated national policing operation.In June 1984, thousands of miners from across Britain picketed at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in a bid to stop lorries delivering coal and collecting coke for Scunthorpe power plant. On 18 June, tensions reached boiling point. Police in riot gear on mounted horses charged at miners, leading to violent clashes. Ninety-five people were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder. All were later cleared.Arthur Scargill vetoed a national ballot on the strike, allowing regional NUM votes instead. In Nottinghamshire, parts of Derbyshire and North Wales, miners voted against joining the walkout and many carried on working. They were known as ""scabs"" by striking miners, who picketed as they arrived at work. Peter Short, a union official, was among those who worked.After a year on strike, a growing number of miners were choosing to return to work. On 3 March,1984, NUM leaders voted to end the dispute without an agreement with the NCB and instructed members to go back to work.By the end of 1985, 23 pits including Cortonwood had shut. Ninety-seven further closures followed before the coal industry was privatised in 1994. The UK's last deep coal mine shut in 2015.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze However, the chancellor told the BBC he could not give ""an absolute guarantee"" that the places needed would all be available in time. From April, the government has promised working parents of two-year-olds in England 15 hours of free care a week.Labour said the commitment was ""in tatters"", describing it as a ""botched pledge without a plan"". Under proposals announced in last year's Budget, the government is rolling out the expansion of free childcare in stages. Working parents of three and four-year-olds are already able to get 30 hours of free childcare. From September, it will be extended to 15 hours for those aged nine months and above. Then from September 2025, the government has pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for all under-fives. However, nurseries and other early years providers have warned they will struggle to meet the expected demand for the scheme. The sector argues that years of underfunding has led to a recruitment and retention crisis, meaning there are not enough staff to deliver the policy. Nurseries have also complained of delays in confirming how much they will be paid to offer free hours. Meanwhile, some parents have reported challenges finding local nurseries offering free hours which have places available. Asked if he could give a guarantee to parents and childcare providers that all the places needed to deliver the pledge would be ready for April, Mr Hunt said the policy amounted to ""the biggest expansion of childcare in a generation"". ""It may mean that we need to employ 40,000 more people in the sector and that's why we're bringing it in stages,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""You'll understand why I don't want to give an absolute guarantee. But am I confident we are delivering this programme and it will be on track for this April? Yes, I am. ""Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused Mr Hunt of ""rushing out"" the commitment ""with no plan to make it happen"". ""Now it's working parents, who in the weeks and months ahead - when they go and try and access those places that have been promised - will discover that they just can't be delivered in the way that he set out,"" she told the programme. She has written to the chancellor to demand the free childcare pledge will be delivered as scheduled and without parents facing extra charges. Asked what provision Labour would guarantee if it wins power, Ms Phillipson said: ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes the Conservatives have made - rushing something out without a plan to make it happen. ""She added her party had commissioned a review of early years by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir David Bell, which she said would look at how to drive up standards and ensure childcare places were available. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said the chancellor needed to address ""the huge challenges facing early years providers"", including by offering sustainable funding rates and removing business rates. ""This is the only way that nurseries can plan for a sustainable future and be able to deliver the increased childcare offer being made to parents,"" she said.Free childcare: Keegan confident of April startCash offer for new childcare workers amid shortageFamilies won't miss out on childcare - ministerWho gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply?

""My first proper run with other people was the Wimpole Estate Parkrun in July 2021. ""Mr Dawson has joined Cambridge running group, 10K Tourists, which runs 10kms around Cambridge on Wednesday evenings, starting and finishing at various local pubs.

""I looked on the back of the packet at the ingredients and thought they weren't likely to improve your health in a significant way,"" she tells the BBC.Another company, Rheal Superfoods, which was featured on BBC programme Dragon's Den in 2021, claims its daily super greens blend supports digestive health, immune system and ""overall wellness from within"".Free Soul's FS Greens blend also makes similar claims, promising to offer digestion and immunity support through key ingredients such as ashwagandha, golden kiwi and maca.A spokesperson for Athletic Greens told the BBC: ""Our team of scientists and researchers have reviewed thousands of studies as part of the formulation and continuous improvement process for AG1."" The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"".Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing.These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety.Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality. ""She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable."" Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"".She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"".Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"".One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030. ""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC. ""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds.Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose. ""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says. ""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds.Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health.Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"".There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"". ""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds.Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit. ""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds.She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables.Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"". ""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds.She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist.Plant-based diets good for the heartBigger breakfasts better for controlling appetiteVegetables alone not enough to reduce heart riskLiquid diets: Do they work and are they safe? RNLI heritage manager David Weldon said he was ""blown away"" by the display, organised to coincide with the charity's 200th anniversary.Sir William Hillary was living in Douglas and witnessed numerous shipwrecks around the coast when he petitioned for the institution.Sir William founded the RNLI in 1824.All At Sea, at the House of Manannan in Peel, was officially opened by the island's lieutenant governor ahead of the anniversary on 4 March.The project, which was a collaboration between the charity and Manx National Heritage (MHH), features some ""very special"" objects, including the gold medal given to Sir William by the institution for founding it.MNH curator Allison Fox said that was a significant feature because ""we know that it was around the coast of the Isle of Man that the idea was formed"".She added: ""He writes in Douglas in February 1823 that the idea of this national institution 'has only suggested itself to me since my residence on a part of the coast often exposed to the most distressing scenes of misery'. ""To have this illustration of that point in history, when this fantastic thing started, is great to have. ""The medal has been loaned to MNH by the RNLI, but the exhibition also contains items relating to the formation from the Manx National Collections.They include original pamphlets outlining what it should be founded on, including the earliest in which Sir William sets out why an organisation was needed, and what it should be. ""This particular one is a first edition and it's just got 'from the author' written on it, which is a nice touch,"" Ms Fox said.Reflecting on the mixture of the island's role as the birthplace of the lifesaving institution and broader Manx maritime heritage, Mr Weldon said the balance of ""tales of endeavour and shipwreck"" together with its place in the RNLI's history was ""just right"".Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

""It can even be used on fingerprints that are a week old. ""Two different coloured dyes, called LFP-Yellow and LFP-Red, bind selectively with the negatively-charged molecules found in fingerprints, locking the dye molecules in place and emitting a fluorescent glow that can be seen under blue light. ""Having two different colours available means the spray can be used on different coloured surfaces. ""We're hoping to produce more colours in the future. ""The dyes are based on a fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is used extensively by research scientists to visualise biological processes. This means the dyes are biologically compatible and don't interfere with subsequent DNA analysis of the fingerprints.The fine spray prevents splashes that could damage prints, is less messy than a powder and works quickly even on rough surfaces where it is harder to capture fingerprints, such as brick.Dr Luling Wu, also from the University of Bath (UK), said: ""The probes are only weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but emit strong fluorescence once they bind to the fingerprints through the interaction between the probes and fatty acids or amino acids. ""The team is working in collaboration with scientists from Shanghai Normal University, China. Principal investigator, Professor Chusen Huang, said: ""We hope this technology can really improve the detection of evidence at crime scenes. ""We are now collaborating with some companies to make our dyes available for sale. Further work is still ongoing.

Her daughter is a pupil at Ballycraigy Primary and she said she had been relieved by the warm welcome. “Coming to this country was not easy for us,"" she explained. ""We don’t know anyone here and we don’t have any family or anything. ""So for Ballycraigy Primary School to have an inclusion week and for them to make us feel like we are part of the family that is very, very important. And I do not take that for granted.”Nosipho said she had never encountered any issues around her race in Ballycraigy. ""Everyone is embracing us. I am happy here now,"" she said.Nosipho Muzvidziwa moved to Northern Ireland from South Africa  Among the delicacies on offer at the food tasting were Chinese soups, Indian daal and fruits from South America. One of the pupils, Kwabena, also known as KO, brought in some noodles which are popular in Ghanian culture.“My friends absolutely loved the noodles; they’d never tried them before but they were a bit spicy,"" he said.His friend Addison said she had yet to try them, but added ""I think that they are amazing”. Jordan Bone, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was just 15 when she became a quadriplegic in the accident.After battling depression, her beauty videos attracted millions of views on YouTube, but singing had always been her passion. ""It feels incredible to have a song out there in the world,"" she said.Ms Bone was a passenger in a car that rolled into a ditch in 2005. ""When I became conscious I was lying against the roof with the seatbelt wrapped around my neck,"" she said. ""I thought I was going to die. I remember thinking, 'I am 15 years old, I've got so much to do'. ""I began singing Candi Staton's You've Got the Love - and it was probably just a whisper - but it brought me back to the moment. It felt like singing saved me. ""Ms Bone said she realised in that moment that she was paralysed, but she assumed that after spinal surgery life would be ""exactly the same, but in a wheelchair"". ""I didn't realise all the support I would need,"" she said. ""At that time I was starting to get more independence; to have that taken away felt like starting from scratch. ""After a couple of years it really hit me, I became down and I felt quite isolated and excluded - especially as a teenager, as if being a teenager isn't hard enough. ""In time, guided meditations helped her, and she began to post her own positivity videos about beauty and living with a disability. ""You didn't see many people with disability in the beauty world, and I wanted to be one of those people to help make those changes,"" she said.Ms Bone has always loved singing and songwriting, and she has now teamed up with musician Jim Kakes to release ""dream pop"" tune Solid Ground. ""The song is about love, trust and the twists and turns that come with it, the desire and insecurities from past situations and expecting something unhealthy when, surprisingly, it is grounded and safe,"" she said. ""You start from you own ideas and you are making something that everyone can now listen to, so that part of the process feels quite magical, and it feels so special to me. ""I want to keep the momentum going; I am really proud of it and I want to become a stronger songwriter. ""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Got a story?

""The farmers were protesting over the foreign imports of food which the said was damaging British farmingSome bystanders applauded the convoy as it passed through the city.One said: ""I'm here to back British food and British farming, and to ensure that the government know all the supermarkets that are selling imports from Spain should be fighting to support these guys who are having a pretty rough time. ""In a statement, the Defra said: “We firmly back our farmers. ""British farming is at the heart of British trade and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.“We’ve maintained the £2.4 billion annual farming budget which supports farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably and are also looking at ways to further improve fairness in the supply chain and support British farmers and growers, as well as ensuring customers have access to high-quality fresh British products.”The Canterbury protest follows a tractor go-slow demonstration at the port of DoverAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at British Retail Consortium, said: “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers. ""Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce.

""I've been trying to get this job for eight years, constantly grinding, constantly asking to do little slots,"" he said. ""No-one is given a job here because their mum or dad helped them into it. You have to earn your colours."" Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club. ""North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication. ""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said. ""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them. ""Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online. ""Someone commented, 'I think Jamie Laing's a really great guy', and someone wrote underneath saying, 'What planet are you on? Is there oxygen?'

Police Scotland said he was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement, released by the force on Sunday, Thomas' family said they were ""utterly heartbroken"".It continued: ""Thomas was the perfect son. He was the best little brother to his older sister and was adored by all his family. ""Thomas went to Cramond Primary School which he loved. He made good friends there. We will all miss him terribly. ""The family, who live in Edinburgh, added they were very grateful for all the sympathy and heartfelt messages they had received.On Friday, Helen Donaldson, head teacher of Cramond Primary School, said Thomas was ""always smiling"" and that he was a ""positive, friendly and curious"" boy.She said: ""We are utterly devastated by the tragic news of the sudden death of one our pupils. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this incredibly difficult time. ""He was kind and always eager to support others, and will be greatly missed by all of us. ""Insp Andrew Thomson said: ""Our thoughts are very much with Thomas's family and friends. Specially trained officers are supporting the family at this time. ""We are continuing with our inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would appeal to anyone who may have information, and has not yet contacted police, is to get in touch with officers."" Insp Thomson also urged anyone with private CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.The bin lorry driver was not injured in the incident, which happened near the junction with Braehead Road.Thomas is the second child to be killed after being hit by a bin lorry in Scotland this year.Last month an 11-year-old girl died in hospital in Edinburgh a week after she was critically injured in the Borders.Elizabeth Bell was struck by a vehicle on the A6105, near East Gordon, on 31 January.Boy, aged 11, dies after being hit by bin lorryContact Police Scotland One video, which has had millions of views, shows the mysterious figure appearing from behind a mirror to whimpering children.But now The Unknown has been unmasked as 16-year-old Felicia, from Glasgow.And she is thrilled her first paid acting job has gone viral.The villain was met with confusion worldwide as The Unknown was noticeably absent from the plot of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Felicia told BBC Scotland News: ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""In the lead up to last month's event the organisers, House of Illuminati, advertised a ""journey filled with wondrous creations"".Willy Wonka was a fictional chocolatier who ran a competition for lucky finders of a golden ticket to visit his factory.But visitors who hoped to relive the classic book and movies - including the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder - were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at a sparsely-decorated warehouse.The event was held last weekend in an industrial estate in Whiteinch, where actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a small bouncy castle.Children were offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans on their trip to the imaginary sweet factory.Parents paid up to £35 a ticket but were so appalled they called Police Scotland. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.According to the script, which is said to be the result of artificial intelligence, The Unknown was an evil rival chocolate maker who lives in walls.The story involves his attempt to steal Willy's ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"".Felicia was originally cast in the starring role of Willy McDuff - seemingly inspired by Willy Wonka - before opting for The Unknown.A video of the villain, dressed in a silver mask and black cloak, emerging from behind a mirror to unhappy children took off on social media last week.The teenager said: ""There weren't any rehearsals. I got there early to practise but it hadn't been set up. ""The actors came up later and it still hadn't been set up. ""We were all saying it was a mess and there hadn't been any organisation, but we were just hoping that together it wouldn't be that bad. But it was. ""The actors were told to improvise on the day, so Felicia waited behind the mirror for each of the three Willy McDuff characters to pass through with their group.She said: ""My character didn't make any sense without the Wonka explaining who I was, that I was The Unknown, an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls. ""So I was just sitting behind the mirror trying to act creepy because that was the only direction I was given. ""It was definitely a mixed bag of reactions. Some people loved it, some people were terrified of it. ""But I think most people didn't really know what I was there for - which was the same for me. ""Felicia said her concerns about the performance intensified just 45 minutes after the doors opened.She recalled: ""The first few runs were actually working quite well because there was order in it. ""But people were straggling in and then it was just all going wrong. ""In the room next to the mirror, one of the Wonkas had been in there for like an hour straight and he hadn't left and the other two Wonkas had just disappeared. ""During that time more people were coming along and it would build up and build up. ""I was sitting behind the mirror texting my mum saying it was going so wrong. ""Felicia said each Wonka led a group of about 60 people and often they could not all fit in one room.She added: ""One of the other Wonkas made up a storyline that if the children pulled a silly face at me, I would be scared and hide back in my corner. ""That worked really well and it would kind of make sense with the plot. ""But that didn't happen every time so sometimes I just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner. ""Felicia revealed she still has the costume from the event and said it was ""quite funny"" that people had been asking for it.After the experience was shut down, the actors went to the pub for a debrief.She recalled: ""When we came back it was just a big massive mob outside. ""There were like four police cars outside. It was really crazy. ""But despite the backlash, Felicia said the response had been positive on the whole.She added: ""At first I was really embarrassed about it. But when we went to the pub after, we were just laughing about it. ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""And now it's become viral, it's genuinely life-changing and I'm really happy I did it. ""Everybody loves the character and posting about it, so it makes me happy that people can see the funny side."" Doctor's had described Elijah, from Pontypridd, as a medical ""mystery"" and were unable to explain his constant illness prior his diagnosis.Chloe Jones, Elijah's mum and also a nurse, said he has ""never gone longer than two weeks"" without becoming ill.Elijah is now in need of a bone marrow transplant and his family are urging people to help them find a match.Chloe said she first began to piece together why Elijah had been in and out of hospital for almost 18 months, while giving him a bath. ""I noticed there were quite a few bruises going along his spine… then I noticed his mouth and his tongue and lips had all of these blood spots and they looked like blisters,"" she said. She and her partner Rhys began to consider that low levels of blood platelets - cells which help prevent bleeding - could be affecting Elijah's health.After a 10-day stay in the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, Elijah was diagnosed with genetic condition Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood cancer which affects young children.In just 12 weeks, Elijah had developed tonsillitis, croup, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, and an ear infection. ""If he just had a common cold it would lead to something else, it would be sickness, he would be off his food... and then it would be something else - it was just constant,"" said Chloe.Chemotherapy is not as effective for treating Elijah's condition, as JMML is not an active cancer, lying  dormant until patients become unwell.Elijah requires a bone marrow transplant, where healthy stem cells are implanted into the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy cells.His family are now appealing for people to sign up to the stem cell register, in order to give Elijah the best chance of finding a donor match.Elijah's appeal has received the support of blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as well as a number of celebrities and sports stars. A social media post from Chloe to update friends and family about her son's progress was shared by far and wide, including by former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp.Chloe said she and Rhys had been trying to keep Elijah's life as normal as possible, by doing a lot of outdoor activities such as walks and trips to the park, but his life has become limited. ""We've taken him out of childcare, to just try and eliminate any risk of him getting any kind of illness at childcare, soft plays, anywhere like that is a 'no go' zone,"" she said. Speaking ahead of his second birthday celebrations, Chloe said it had been ""really hard"" to make any plans. ""I can't guarantee what the weather is going to be like, I can't plan anything, so no plans yet. Hopefully we can just go for a walk or to the park. As much as I love Wales it is quite tough. ""Despite his health troubles, Chloe says Elijah hasn't let his condition slow him down, and that ""you wouldn't think anything was wrong if you saw him"". ""Even when he was really unwell and he was in hospital he was still running up and down the corridors, going into the other children's rooms, pinching chocolates and snacks... he is definitely a little soldier."" Chloe said it had been helpful to finally have some answers for Elijah's health problems, and to have the support of parents of other children her son had been in hospital with. In an appeal for people to add their name to the stem cell register, she said: ""You don't know how much it's needed until you see it first hand and it's such a simple thing to do to donate your bone marrow. ""It's absolutely life changing for those who need it and there are so many people who do need it, and there's not enough people on the register. ""It's so simple to get on the register, if you're already donating blood or platelets, it's just a tick box, and if you're not, it's just a mouth swab. It's so simple, and if you get called up you're potentially saving a life.

You need to make space for yourself wherever you go.Now she is a teenager, I don't want my daughter to lose the big dreams and bold ambitions that I lost as a girl.At school, in Luton in the early 1990s, I remember learning about world leaders in history. ""That's what I want to be,"" I thought. ""I'm going to become prime minister."" But then somebody would say: ""Well, have you ever seen a brown prime minister?"" And that particular dream would be squashed.It makes you think how far we have come today.As I approached the age my daughter is now, Nadiya the dreamer was disappearing. I could see that the path ahead of me was to be different to that of my brothers. There was a hierarchy in my family - and men were always at the top. My brothers had freedom, they could socialise, and they could get an education. Although I worked hard in my A-levels and wanted to go to university, my mum told me there was absolutely no way. ""You're a girl, you need to get married,"" she said. I felt as though the person who once had been so lively was disappearing. But now, when I look back, I am proud of who I have become. I think my children are too.Dear Daughter: Elbows out with Nadiya HussainListen on BBC SoundsWhen I was a little girl, I never saw anyone like me on a TV cookery show. OK, I might not be prime minister, but thanks to my passion for baking, I have become a British Bangladeshi in the public eye. Baking built my confidence and helped me cope with my anxiety - I have PTSD and panic disorder. It helped me make connections with people, through the sharing of food.Maybe the big dreams of Nadiya, the little girl, weren't so unrealistic after all.Both my daughter and eldest son love baking. My second son does the dishes. My husband on the other hand is a terrible cook. Once, as he was boiling eggs, they exploded and hit the ceiling.My daughter is very smart, conscientious and kind. She rolls her eyes sometimes when I give her advice - but I know she is really listening deep down.When I sent this letter to my daughter on her phone, she asked if we could frame it and put it in her room. ""Absolutely, we'll frame it,"" I said. I never want to lose our lines of communication.This is your Ma, though when I speak, I know you do not listen. Not really. You shrug. You dismiss, you reel in disgust, as I suggest that I may know better. You look at me and all you see is your mother. The Woman, the person you have known your whole life.You see what is stood in front of you, though often bedraggled. I am here. I am your mother. That is all you see. Not the person that came before her. Let me tell you a little bit about that little girl.That girl, well, she was nothing like your mother. This girl, she was wild. She had great thoughts and even greater dreams. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She spoke about how she felt. She spoke about change. She preached about fairness. Even at her tender age. She knew where she wanted to be. Despite the blockades that life had in store for her.Sometimes I daydream and wonder where that little girl went. How did she disappear out of plain sight so fast? Then I look at you and realise you are that little girl. Same, but entirely different. Fierce, bold and bright, like your mother before you.This is your Ma. Though even when I speak, I know you do not listen. Just know that the little girl inside me that I once was, and I once lost, is holding your hand. And we won't lose another little girl ever again. Let your fire always be fierce. May your purpose guide you. Be the brightest shining light.Baking the Queen's birthday cake More than 4,500 people work at Asos's distribution centre in Grimethorpe - more than that who live in the former south Wales mining village of Maerdy.How well they've responded to losing their mine, the old village heartbeat, depends on your barometer of success.Is getting bigger better, or is it all about a tight-knit community spirit?A quarter of the Welsh population live in former coalfield communities and near the head of the Rhondda Valley in Maerdy, there's a few shops, takeaways, a pub and one road in and one road out. On a busy day, it can take almost two-and-a-half hours on public transport to get the nearest big city, so locals say people have to move away from their community to get work.Roads, railway lines and more importantly industry - or jobs  - never arrived after the pit shut in 1990, five years after miners went back to work following the miners' strike. ""Lots of things were promised, but not a lot of things came to the valley,"" said Dawn Wood, who was deputy head at Maerdy Primary for 45 years, including during the strike. ""That is a condemnation of any government, whether it's Labour, Conservative, every government. I cannot blame one more than the other. ""Coal has been at the heart of everything in Maerdy for more than 100 years - livelihoods, the social and sporting scene. The mine was the community.When miners marched back to work at the local mine in 1985 after the strike, it was the beginning of the end for coal mining in the village.The town walked in lockstep with the miners, accompanied by a brass band, but within five years the pit was gone for good - and Dawn, now in her 60s, reckons the village's fortunes have steadily declined. ""It is the lack of foresight, they promise things but they don't put it in,"" said Dawn. ""So as far as I'm concerned it is not the people that have let the valleys down, it is governments that have let the valleys down. ""Dawn isn't alone as a new BBC survey suggests three in five people said closing the pits had a negative impact on their area - and almost three-quarters polled said they'd seen little or no regeneration. ""Shops have closed, everybody had to go out of the valley to work... It's all gone, it's not the same,"" said lifelong Maerdy resident Phil Pugh.There is also more deprivation, higher unemployment and poorer health, and new research estimates nearly 20% of people are out of work in the village deep in the Rhondda Fach Valley. ""We haven't got a train, they promised a new road that was supposed to come all the way up to Maerdy, but it only came up as far as Pontygwaith,"" said Gill Owen and Trina Coombs, who join the Knit and Natter group in Maerdy every Tuesday. ""You've got one road in and one road out. Big businesses will not come up here, because of the cost of their travelling time. If there's an accident, you can't get out. ""Last year the workmens' club in Tylorstown got burnt down. We were stuck for four days. ""While the last four decades haven't been kind to Maerdy, some former coalfield communities have flourished.Miners in the Yorkshire village Grimethorpe in south Yorkshire marched back to work around the same time as those in Maerdy, also accompanied by their own brass band made famous by the Ewan McGregor film Brassed Off.Grimethorpe's pit shut in 1993 - and within a year the village near Barnsley was considered the poorest in the UK with half the workforce unemployed. ""Let's be blunt, the government walked away - it devastated that community and said goodbye... and in a sense everything just imploded,"" said Sir Stephen Houghton, head of the multi-agency Grimethorpe Regeneration Board.This video can not be playedThe story of the miners' strikes in Wales in 1984 and 1985""This wasn't miners losing a few jobs, they lost a whole way of life. Everything disappeared overnight. Society in the village started to break down. Crime and disorder went through the roof. ""But a £100m injection built new roads, attracted industry including international fashion retailer Asos, and Grimethorpe - about halfway between Leeds and Sheffield - has grown. ""We had to show the people of Grimethorpe, that somebody cared about them and would work with them, and try and find funds, to try and turn the thing around,"" added Sir Stephen, now Barnsley council leader.Grimethorpe grew - the fortunes of the village and those who lived there changed - but not everyone benefited. ""The new road opened up a lot of possibilities,"" said internationally-renowned dance artist Gary Clarke, who is was born and bred in Grimethorpe. ""It's also brought a lot of new people into the village. I don't want to paint a picture like it's all a bed of roses. It's definitely not. The scars still run very deep in Grimethorpe. ""You can see the division between the old community and some of the newer people that come into the village. What brings people together in Grimethorpe is the legacy of the place. ""A lot of the newer people don't necessarily know the history that Grimethorpe is built on and so with that I think they don't have that community spirit. The soul of Grimethorpe's changed dramatically, but we are trying our best to bring those two sides together. ""It's the opposite back in Maerdy. While some may think they have nothing, others feel having each other is everything - a community spirit that many villages yearn for. ""Open your door, and there's always somebody who'd do you a favour"", says Karen Knott, enjoying a weekly catch-up at Knit and Natter. ""If you were ill, they'd post you a letter, get you a pint of milk - they'd still do it now. My husband was putting an old bike in the car the other day, and somebody came along and asked if he needed any help. ""The current head at the local school likens the current cost of living crisis to the strike in the 80s - and she feels it was community that got people through then, and it will be community that will get people through now. ""During the strike people stood together and helped each other,"" said Maerdy primary head Helen Gregory. ""Today with the financial climate that we're in, people need help as they did back then and we still have people standing side by side helping each other. ""If you go out and about in Maerdy people know each other, people care about each other. There are not many jobs in Maerdy - but we're proud to live here. ""Welsh miners in Ukraine to repay 1984 strike helpHow did the miners' strike affect Wales?Voices from the 1984 miners' strike They have been organised by the Memory Stones of Love group, which was set up by families wanting to remember their loved ones together.Events are taking place across the UK on Sunday to remember lives lost as part of a national day of reflection.In Londonderry bereaved families took part in a walk across the Peace Bridge.A minute's silence was then held in the city's Peace Flame Garden.Ciaran Ward's parents Bredge and Owen Ward, from Strabane, County Tyrone, died within 12 hours of each other in November 2020. ""Today is a special day for all of the bereaved families to come together to grieve together to remember their loved ones,"" Mr Ward told BBC News NI. ""For myself, during the pandemic to lose Mum and Dad, it feels surreal, it still doesn't feel real. ""Mr Ward recalled being unable to visit his parents in hospital due to the strict measures put in place at the time to reduce transmission of the Covid-19 virus. ""Not being able to see them - everyone in life wants to be with their family as they pass away,"" he said. ""And they also want to be at home. And for us, for Mum and Dad - they were denied that. ""He added: ""It's important that as a collective society that we all come together and we remember the horror that has happened and the trauma that has happened for so many people. ""Catriona Myles's father Gerry McLarnon was 67 when he died during the pandemic. She recalled how her dad, who suffered from cancer, died without family members present when he was admitted to hospital in December 2020 after contracting Covid.The annual day of reflection is ""so important for the families"", she said.She said she was at Sunday's event ""to bring comfort, compassion and solidarity to other families that have faced the same losses as ourselves"". ""Everyone wants to move on and I understand that as a society we need to move on but, for the families, there are so many questions unanswered,"" she added. ""And it's a very lonely place that we're in a lot of the time. ""Families also attended events in Belfast and Enniskillen to remember those who died. In Belfast Memory Stones of Love organised a the craft event, from which bereaved family members planned to walk together to Belfast City Hall, which will be lit up yellow in memory of those who died.Last year the group laid more than 300 memory stones in the shape of a heart outside City Hall.The stones were individually painted and bore the name of a loved one who died in the pandemic.Other public buildings across Northern Ireland, including the Guildhall in Derry, will also be illuminated yellow on Sunday evening as a mark of respect. Covid bereaved gather to remember lost loved onesCouple dies 12 hours apart with Covid-19Politicians lack humanity, Covid daughter says ""It was mental,"" said Meg and Charlie, both 29, who live in Swansea. James gifted the couple the tickets for the show, which took place at London's O2 Arena, as an engagement present.The DJ also spent the night itself at the couple's home in Swansea, babysitting their daughter, Maisie, seven - where he got his nails painted. ""Maisie absolutely loved it,"" said Meg, who's originally from Pontypridd, joking that James had a ""similar mindset of age"" to their daughter. James appeared to enjoy himself as well, posting a picture of him playing with Maisie's doll house, as well as a video of them together at the park. He also posted a list of chores Maisie had given him, which included washing the dishes with pink gloves, reading time, and salon time.A photo posted later in the night showed James with a set of pink nails. The relationship between the couple and the DJ started when Charlie appeared on a segment of James' show called What's my Age Again, and ""stupidly"" got his own age wrong. It developed from there, with both Charlie and Meg appearing on the show, both individually and together, in the last few months. They appeared again on Friday and were expecting to take part in a ""Mr and Mrs"" style quiz, which Meg said she had researched for. ""But it was a complete ploy - they told us the truth, that they wanted us to swap lives,"" she said. James said he had attended the show before, and wanted to give away his and his wife's tickets. He offered to babysit the couple's daughter, and on Saturday Meg and Charlie travelled to London where they were put up in a hotel. ""The only thing we had to worry about what was finding something to wear,"" Meg said.They said they had an ""amazing time"" at the show, with seats close to the stage, and indulged in a fair amount of celeb-spotting. They were also full of praise for James, describing him as a ""selfless"" and ""genuine person"". Meg is a maternity worker for the NHS, and Charlie a field technician for an advertising company, and the couple joked they had a ""very romantic story"" of meeting online. Meg is originally from Pontypridd and Charlie from Essex, and James has described the couple as ""a real life Gavin and Stacey"". ""To be honest, we're more like Nessa and Smithy,"" said Meg, referring to the characters played by James Corden and Ruth Jones. ""We like KFC too much."" It was a night out the television characters would likely have embraced. ""We were back by 2am. We ended the night with a McDonald's - that's our kind of night,"" Meg said.

Researchers at the University of Surrey taught an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict the 3D pose from a 2D image of a dog.A myriad of virtual dogs were created using the video game Grand Theft Auto.Postgraduate research student Moira Shooter said: ""From ecology to animation, this neat solution has so many possible uses. ""One way to teach AI to get 3D information from 2D images is to show it photos while giving it information about 3D 'ground truth' - where the objects are in 3D space.For humans, that means wearing motion capture suits. Unable to replicate the same with dogs, researchers altered the code of Grand Theft Auto V, switching the main character for one of eight breeds of dog - a process known as modding.They generated 118 videos of the dogs sitting, walking, barking and running in a range of different weather and lighting conditions. The team called their new database DigiDogs, which was made up of 27,900 frames.They now plan to fine tune the system using Meta's DINOv2 model to make sure it can predict a 3D pose just as well from real dog pictures. ""Our model was trained on CGI dogs, but we were able to use it to make 3D skeletal models from photographs of real animals,"" Ms Shooter said. ""That could let conservationists spot injured wildlife, or help artists create more realistic animals in the metaverse. She added: ""3D poses contain so much more information than 2D photographs.

The HeraldThe ScotsmanDaily RecordThe Scottish SunDaily MailScottish Daily ExpressThe TimesThe TelegraphThe NationalThe CourierThe P&JGlasgow TimesEdinburgh News Wiltshire's chalk streams host a huge amount of wildlife and despite looking clear, they have been failing to meet ""good"" ecological health status. The Wylye Chalk Stream Project involves farmers, the Wessex Rivers Trust (WRT) and the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust (WWT).Alice Eley, WWT's water team manager, said: ""They [chalk streams] support very unique biodiversity. ""The project, which Ms Eley said is of an ""unprecedented"" scale, has been funded by the government's Landscape Recovery scheme.Some of the wildlife supported by chalk streams and rivers in Wiltshire, such as in the Wylye Valley and Salisbury Plain, include salmon, brown trout, otters and water voles. Chalk streams come straight from the aquifer, a type of rock or sediment which holds groundwater, with the water filtered through the chalk, giving it unique features like a neutral temperature all year round.Ms Eley said the conditions helped certain plants to thrive, such as water crowfoot (Ranunculus), ""which is what these rivers are designated for,"" she added. ""They [chalk streams] react very strongly to pollution. A small water quality change can have a devastating impact on chalk streams,"" Ms Eley said.Josh Stratton is one of the group of farmers in the area involved in the project - they want to return the river to it's natural course and closer to the environment that it would have enjoyed a century or two ago.On one stretch, he has put in gravel to make it shallow in parts, but also made deeper areas, as well as sections that are fast or slow-flowing.Changes like this provide a larger variety of habitats for wildlife, including improving conditions for fish spawning. ""This land is almost post-agricultural so my tonnes per hectare of water voles will be increasing not my tonnes per hectare of wheat,"" explained Mr Stratton.He said he is excited about the project and pleased that the government has put in a framework, but said the science helps too: ""Having real scientists to make it work for farmers has helped. You can't expect farmers to do that in isolation. ""The Wylye Chalk Stream Project is one of 34 successful schemes to come from the Landscape Recovery fund.Ms Eley said: ""Farmers are almost the lifeblood of the river - all of our rivers go through farmland. ""We want farmers to give rivers space - to grow, move, flood out, to do all the things a natural river should do.

It would be the biggest ever rollout of new bathing water sites as part of the Government's plan to improve water quality across the country. ""This is a massive win for ordinary Taunton residents and users of our River Tone,"" said Mr Amos.

There have also been a spate of failures, including broken rails and signalling faults.The route is now set to be overhauled in three phases over 18 months.Thousands of runners have taken to the streets for an annual half marathon in Berkshire.About 3,500 competitors, including elite runners, began running the Wokingham Half Marathon at 10:00 GMT.Starting and finishing at Cantley Park, the race takes participants through the town centre, although a contingency route has been put in place this year due to flooding.Organisers said the event raises more than £100,000 for charity each year.Antlers on a life-size stag sculpture were sawn off in a spate of ""wanton vandalism"", a resident has said.Clean cut marks can be seen towards the base of each antler on the monument in Savernake Park, Bracknell, suggesting they were deliberately removed.Ken Toogood, one of those to spot the damage, said those responsible must have been ""clandestine"" and it looked ""premeditated"" given the use of tools.Were it not for a nearby sign, passers-by would have no clue what once stood on a grassy spot in Berkshire.Beside an arrow pointing to a campus gym, another points to the Imperial College Reactor Centre in Ascot.While the sports building is clearly visible, all that stands in front of it now is an open field.But for almost half a century, the patch of grass - not far from Ascot's world-famous racecourse and Legoland - was home to a nuclear reactor.Now, after 10 years' work, it has become the first civil nuclear site in Britain to be fully decommissioned - the point where regulators have been able to revoke its licence and end the strict controls imposed to protect the public.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Harri Barker has helped to bring saunas to the GowerThey are more commonly spotted in the corners of gyms and luxury hotels - but saunas are starting to pop up on the Welsh coast.Swansea's Gower peninsula in winter may seem like a strange place to relax in your swimsuit, but more and more people are visiting, keen to chase away the rainy day blues.It is the Scandinavian model being followed - where people can move from the cold of the sea, quickly to the warm. The British Sauna society (BSS) was set up almost 10 years ago with a focus on bringing the authentic sauna to the UK, and said numbers have doubled, with an increasing amount outside.It believes these could potentially replace pubs and community centres which are closing - but what is the appeal?‘’It is time away from your phone, time away from the rush of everyday life,"" Harri Barker told BBC Wales Live. ""It kind of brings you back to earth a little bit.’’ She set up Ty Sawna on the Gower in 2022, with one of they reasons being its connection to nature. ‘’That is what it's all about,’’ she added.‘’It can be sunny, raining, snowing or stormy, but you just sit in the sauna and it's like a portal that takes you somewhere else.’""It’s an activity which encourages others to get outside during the winter season. ‘’When a lot of people find it really difficult to cope over the colder months, it’s a way to get people out and meeting new people.’’Scotland’s new wild sauna culture.

The Bridge Head is now displayed prominently on signs, with its Welsh-language name appearing in smaller writing below.The BBC has contacted the owners to respond. ""It disparages the Welsh language... this is some kind of slapdash translation, which is unacceptable,"" said local Dylan Rhys Jones. ""You have the English translation in big letters and the Welsh name in small letters underneath. ""I don't see the reason why they need to change the name. ""Gareth Bolton, who also lives nearby, said the decision to ""rebrand the pub"" had attracted a lot of attention from local residents on social media.He said he was in favour of empty buildings being brought back to life but not ""mindlessly changing names from Welsh to English"".He pointed to another example - Y Gwindy being changed to The Winery, adding: ""At the end of the 19th century, Abergele had 16 pubs, all of them with an English name apart from Pen-Y-Bont and the Gwindy. ""The names of these institutions are woven into local culture, identity and history. ""The savage act of erasing our language is atrocious. ""Language use has divided opinion, with some saying that where names are similar - such as Treorci/Treorchy or Caerffili/Caerphilly - the Welsh version only could be used.Some national parks have also moved to use Welsh names only, such as Eryri and Bannau Brycheiniog - formerly known as Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons respectively.In Eryri, Llyn Tegid has sometimes been known as Lake Bala, and Llyn Bochlwyd as Lake Australia.Should some place names be written only in Welsh?Translation error directs drivers to 'town egg gas'U-turn on street signs means they will be in Welsh Carwyn Powell said he felt ""stranded"" after Spot the collie disappeared. The Pet Abduction Bill will not apply to Wales as animal welfare is a devolved matter. The Welsh government said to ensure its resources have most impact in delivering its animal welfare plan, Wales will not be included in the bill.Currently, pet theft is classed under the Theft Act, meaning that a stolen pet is treated as inanimate property under the law. The Pet Abduction Bill, brought forward by Conservative MP Anna Firth, will make it a specific offence to abduct a pet in England and Northern Ireland.Under the new legislation, anyone convicted of the offence could face a fine or a maximum of five years in prison.But as animal welfare is a devolved matter, it is up to the Senedd to bring forward similar measures in Wales.Mr Powell's Collie, Spot, went missing in December 2018.Despite an extensive search, Spot has not been seen since. Mr Powell, 58, from Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire, said losing Spot was devastating. ""It's like losing a member of the family,"" he said. ""When we are doing something at home, you know there's somebody missing. When a dog's been stolen, there's no closure at all on it. You don't know what's happened to her. ""Mr Powell said that the law as it stands was not strong enough to tackle pet thefts. ""Something needs to be done about it because people are left just stranded really. There's no assistance coming from anywhere but in England and [Northern] Ireland now, they will have a bit of assistance if this bill goes through Parliament, but in Wales, there's nothing forthcoming. ""A pet theft taskforce was set up following a rise in pet thefts during the pandemic, and an abduction bill was one of its recommendations. Former Welsh Secretary and MP for South Swindon, Sir Robert Buckland, who was a member of that taskforce, said: ""The trouble with the Theft Act is that it deals with property and a lot of people think of pets as more than just property. ""We want families to enjoy the protection of the law and that's why abduction is a much better way of looking at it than treating animals as mere property. ""Sir Robert called on the Welsh government to enact a similar change, and said pet owners in Wales ""should not be put in a different position"" to those in other parts of the UK.Debbie Matthews, co-founder of the Stolen and Missing Pets Alliance, which began calling for reforms to the law a decade ago, said: ""It must be terribly worrying for the people in Wales. ""I know Scotland are putting through a dog theft law, if Wales aren't, does that mean that Wales is going to become the hotspot for taking dogs and cats? ""RSPCA Cymru is concerned that pets in Wales could be targeted more in other parts of the UK. Billie-Jade Thomas of RSPCA Cymru said: ""We hope that the Welsh government will continue to monitor the situation and that the decision that they have made is the result of an evidence-based approach. ""RSPCA Cymru recommends the following measures for owners to safeguard their pets: A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We want all animals to have a good quality life. We are delivering this through our programme of ambitious reforms set out in our animal welfare plan. ""Our focus is on areas which will bring greatest benefit to animal welfare across Wales, including our current consultation on licensing animal welfare establishments, exhibits and activities. ""To ensure our resources have the maximum impact on animal welfare, Wales won't be included in the scope of the Pet Abductions Bill"".More on Politics Wales on BBC One Wales, Sunday, 10:00 GMT, and on iPlayerCat and dog theft set to be made criminal offenceMen who bred puppies in sheds in £300k ring jailedPolice use DNA profiling to stop dog thefts Bedford Borough Council said six buildings have now been repaired along the High Street where new paving was unveiled in 2021.The High Street Heritage Action Zone (HSHAZ) Programme began four years ago.Vincent Decamps, from Maison Le Vôtre, said he chose Bedford over St Albans as the place to open his patisserie and bakery because of the restorative work.He said the renovations to the High Street and Silver Street, where he is based, brought ""uniformity"" and marked a ""new start for Bedford"".When looking for a location ""the first goal was to go to St Albans"", he said, and when he first looked around Bedford it was ""a no, no"". ""The only thing that attracted me to this position was the renovation of the building itself; if it was not restored I would have gone to St Albans, period, simple as that,"" he said.He said he ""took a massive risk"" and the area was now welcoming customers ""who haven't been in Bedford for two, three, four, five and six years"".The restoration programme, which started in January 2020, was a joint project between the council and Historic England, in partnership with Bedford BID and SEMLEP, and had been ""instrumental in preserving and enhancing the historic fabric of Bedford's town centre"", the council said. Two new businesses had moved into ""units that have been long term vacant"", the authority added.A new display celebrating its completion and featuring photographs, artwork, and information about the evolution of the town's High Street has opened at The Higgins Bedford - and runs until 1 April.Bedford's Evolving High Street exhibition ""offers a fascinating journey through the decades, showcasing the transformation and vitality of our beloved High Street"", the council said.

""I agree with that and I really hope that Wednesday will see a change in the direction that Jeremy Hunt takes, particularly on investment on capital so we that we can invest in our infrastructure, things like affordable housing. ""Ms Robison added taxes should not be reduced as the UK economy had gone into recession and called for the £1.6bn cut to Scotland's five-year capital budget to be reversed.The Scottish government's budget passed its final vote at Holyrood on Tuesday.Ms Robison said her £59.7bn spending plans would protect frontline services and include funding for a council tax freeze.But opposition parties warned the measures could harm economic growth and they criticised cuts for affordable housing.The finance secretary described the budget as ""really challenging"" and said she had to make ""difficult choices"".And she said the affordable housing cuts were linked to UK government cuts in both capital funding and financial transaction funding.Ms Robison added: ""I have said it is the number one issue that I want to address if I get that additional capital from the Spring Budget on Wednesday. ""She also said the one-year freeze on council tax was an intervention designed to help with household budgets during the cost of living crisis.So far 30 of Scotland's 32 local authorities have set their budgets but only two - Argyll & Bute and Inverclyde - have confirmed they will put taxes up for 2024/25.Ms Robison told The Sunday Show: ""We are providing £210m to local authorities to help them freeze the council tax and we expect that council tax payers get some benefit out of that investment. ""The minister added that, given the current financial climate, she believed local authorities had been ""treated fairly"".Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith later criticised her comments.She said: ""It's ridiculous of Shona Robison to be giving the UK chancellor advice on growth, when the SNP's dire record led to her savage tax-and-axe budget that means Scots will be paying more to receive fewer and worse services. ""It's even more absurd for her to call for housing investment, when she has just cut Scotland's housing budget by 26%, and Shelter Scotland say the SNP are 'gaslighting' the public on the subject. ""Ms Smith also described the handling of the council tax freeze as ""shambolic"".She added: ""Her financial incompetence has left councils so desperate that they are appealing directly to the UK government. ""Meanwhile, Scottish Labour's finance spokesman Daniel Johnson said he was ""very uncomfortable"" with the situation faced by local authorities after the council tax freeze announcement.He told The Sunday Show: ""We had a pledge that was driven by the need to give the first minister a talking point at his conference in the autumn. ""Ever since then they have been playing catch up, leaving our councils in utter chaos. ""Mr Johnson also condemned the decision to put plans on hold to build new hospitals, surgeries and a network of treatment centres in Scotland. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said ahead of the 6 March announcement that there was ""too much waste in the system"".As part of the reforms, AI will be used to cut NHS scan times by a third and the police will deploy drones to incidents such as traffic collisions.Labour said the package amounted to ""spin without substance"".Elsewhere, Mr Hunt also hinted that civil service staff numbers could be cuts by tens of thousands. The Treasury is hoping that the proposed technological reforms will deliver as much as £1.8bn worth of benefits to public sector productivity by 2029. ""There is too much waste in the system and we want public servants to get back to doing what matters most: teaching our children, keeping us safe and treating us when we're sick,"" Mr Hunt said. ""That's why our plan is about reaping the rewards of productivity, from faster access to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for patients to hundreds of thousands of police hours freed up to attend burglaries or incidents of domestic abuse. ""The announcement comes as Mr Hunt is under mounting pressure from his Conservative colleagues to deliver tax cuts when he unveils his Budget on Wednesday.The Treasury said the latest move would mean 130,000 patients a year - including those waiting for cancer results - would receive their completed tests quicker as a result of at least 100 MRI scanners in England being upgraded with AI.In policing, it said the reforms would help to deliver on the Police Productivity Review, which it said found up to 38 million hours of officer time could be saved every year.Other key measures in the £800m investment include:Darren Jones, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Nothing in Britain is better off after 14 years of Conservative economic failure. ""Millions of people are stuck on hospital waiting lists, our schools are crumbling and our streets are less safe. And yet all the chancellor is offering is more spin without substance. ""The BBC's Faisal Islam said the Budget came at a time when the government was hoping to have scope to unveil voter-friendly tax cuts ahead of the general election.It initially hoped for ""headroom"" of about £30bn to spend at the start of the year after its borrowing costs fell sharply, but the BBC understands this figure returned to its November level of roughly £13bn by the middle of last month. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Hunt acknowledged the latest forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility had broadly ""gone against us"". ""So it's going to be a Budget where we stress... the importance of being responsible with the country's finances, because it's fundamentally unconservative to fund all the things that you would like to do by borrowing money for future generations,"" he said. Paul Jonson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC that any tax cut in the Budget was ""likely to be undone after the next election, whoever wins"". He added: ""Whatever the scale of the tax cut announced this week, during this parliament taxes will have risen very substantially indeed. ""Mr Hunt also said the government would look to further cut public sector costs by reducing the number of staff in the civil service back to pre-pandemic levels.According to the Institute for Government, staff levels rose from around 423,000 at the start of 2020 to 496,150 in September last year. ""You had a huge expansion of [the] civil service during the pandemic that was justified,"" the chancellor said. ""It was an exceptional situation, but we're not in a pandemic now.

Marco Longhi, a Conservative MP who represents Dudley North in the West Midlands, defended him and said he should not have been suspended from the party. He said there was no evidence his friend was Islamophobic or racist and that he should be re-instated.The Ashfield MP was suspended from the Tory party after he refused to apologise for the remarks, which the prime minister's official spokesperson said were wrong. Mr Longhi told Politics Midlands: ""I think where there might be a slight weakness in his argument is making an assertion that Sadiq Khan is closely associated to Islamist and therefore, by inference, an Islamist himself. ""I think it's right that Lee works this out and I would like to see him return in the Conservative fold as soon as possible."" Lee Anderson has represented Ashfield since 2019Mr Longhi made the remarks during a debate about so-called no-go zones.Another Conservative MP, Paul Scully, apologised last week for suggesting there were ""no-go"" areas in parts of London's Tower Hamlets and Sparkill in Birmingham. The Dudley North MP said those comments were wrong but it did not show the Conservatives were out of touch.

Mr Hunt is under pressure from some Tory MPs to reduce taxes in Wednesday's Budget, ahead of an election which must be held by the end of January. A further cut to National Insurance is believed to be among the measures being considered by the chancellor.In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Hunt said the Budget, when the government sets out its plans for tax and spending, would be about ""long-term growth"". He said he also hoped to ""show a path"" towards a lower-tax economy. ""We've been very consistent, that we would only cut taxes in a way that was responsible and prudent,"" he said. ""The most unconservative thing I could do would be to cut taxes by increasing borrowing. ""Overall the amount of tax people pay is still on course to reach record levels, despite the main rate of National Insurance being cut from 12% to 10% in last year's Autumn Statement. Mr Hunt has repeatedly hinted that he wants to reduce taxes further in the Budget but in recent weeks he has suggested there is likely to be less scope for this than he had hoped. With only 72 hours until the Budget, Mr Hunt was firmly in the damping down expectations mode.At the start of this year, the government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had estimated the chancellor had about £30bn of ""headroom"" to spend in the Budget, after borrowing costs fell sharply.Since then, borrowing costs have begun to rise again and by the middle of last month, the BBC understands the figure was back to its November level of roughly £13bn.With the government's spending rules and the OBR breathing down his neck on one side, and the Tory backbenches who want the historically high taxes cut, it is not a comfortable position. However, there is wide expectation at Westminster that he will reduce some taxes, even if the moves are not significant. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said: ""The chancellor says he wants to cut taxes, but it is the Tories who have raised taxes to their highest level in 70 years. ""No matter what the chancellor does in the Budget this week, working people will be worse off thanks to 14 years of Tory failure. ""Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, told the BBC that any tax cut in the Budget was ""likely to be undone after the next election, whoever wins"".The IFS has also warned that further reducing taxes is likely to mean spending cuts in the future.Asked if the government should be spending more on public services, rather than tax cuts, Mr Hunt said: ""I think what most people want is better public services and a lower tax burden. ""The only way that we have a chance of delivering something like that is by spending the money that we spend on public services much more efficiently."" The government has already announced an £800m package of reforms aimed at freeing up NHS and police time, for example using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to cut NHS scan times and drones to assess incidents such as traffic collisions.Former chief economist at the Bank of England Andy Haldane told the programme he thought the government's self-imposed spending limits - known as ""fiscal rules"" - were ""stunting"" economic growth and constraining the chancellor's decisions.These include getting debt as a proportion of the size of the economy falling in five years. Mr Hunt said he did not agree the government should change its fiscal rules because ""people would interpret that as Britain losing control of its finances"". Recent memories of the meltdown in the financial markets following Liz Truss's mini-Budget in 2022 - which included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - are a reminder of why such rules exist. But there does seem to be growing disquiet that the system that is meant to guarantee stability can have a negative impact too. Meanwhile, the chancellor is also considering other measures to raise revenue, including a new tax on vapes and scrapping non-dom tax status. People with non-domiciled status are UK residents whose home for tax purposes is abroad. Under the current system, they do not have to pay UK tax on money they make overseas.Mr Hunt has previously defended the tax status, arguing it helps make the UK an attractive place for well-off people to live and work. Labour has pledged to abolish non-dom status and spend the money generated on schools and the NHS. If the party backs any tax cuts the chancellor announces, which they are expected to do, this would leave questions over how some of their spending pledges would be funded.Mr Hunt refused to comment on any potential changes to specific taxes.However, he told the BBC: ""The country sees through gimmicks and we are not going to do gimmicks on Wednesday.

Three Kent pits - Snowdown, Tilmanstone and Betteshanger - were in operation in 1984 when the 54-week dispute began.Protests were held against plans by the National Coal Board, supported by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to shut 20 ""unprofitable"" pits nationwide.The National Union of Miners' strike saw miners and police clash on the picket lines across the country.Eventually the Kent miners returned to work but the pits were destined for closure. Betteshanger was the last to close in Kent in 1989.Shaun Parry started working at Snowdown Colliery near Aylesham when he was just 16 years old. He said: ""It was 940m deep, and it was very, very hot. I think the nickname was Dante's inferno. I loved it. ""Mr Parry said he had been detained by police during the strike. ""I hadn't done anything. I was taken to the van and then they cable-tied you to a wire inside the van,"" he said. ""I was frightened. I was really frightened."" Kay Sutcliffe was married to miner Philip Sutcliffe and they lived in the pit village of Aylesham. She said no-one in the village broke the strike and everyone in Aylesham was ""organised and united"".For Mrs Sutcliffe, the strikes were a battle to save not just jobs, but a way of life. After seeing TV reports of miners' wives in Nottinghamshire calling for a return to work, women in Kent, led by Mrs Sutcliffe and others, travelled north to boost support for the stoppage.She penned poems which galvanized dozens of women to march in protest, while her speeches were heard by thousands. Mrs Sutcliffe said: ""I think we were the first women support group that actually publicly were noticed for doing an active thing like that. ""'How is it gonna affect the miners in our community? How is it gonna affect their families if they can't get a job anywhere?' That's the kind of thing I was talking about,"" she told BBC Politics South East.

""Councillor Stephen Philpott, for Peel Common, said he was concerned the grant would be lost if the project did not start this year.The council previously said it was confident work would start in May and be finished in September, protecting the area in time for the winter.Steve Fitzmaurice and Andy Pearce, representing Coastal Partners, gave an update on the Alverstoke, Seafield and Stokes Bay flood defence schemes at the council meeting.They said that while a contractor, West Sussex-based JT Mackley and Co Ltd, had been appointed to start work on flood defence structures at Forton, there was a budget shortfall on the other projects. The Alverstoke sea defences, in the pipeline since 2015, would see the flood risk reduced for 142 homes and businesses. Seafield was also highlighted as one of the three priority areas for a flood defence scheme with 80 homes and businesses at risk, but it has an £800,000 funding gap.Council leader Peter Chegwyn said he wanted the government to provide extra money.Coastal Partners was formed in 2012 to deliver a coastal management service across the coastlines of the local authorities in Havant, Portsmouth, Gosport, Chichester, and Fareham.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Jersey Post said the stamps capture the ""enduring spirit of the RNLI"".A lifeboat was first established in Jersey in 1830, with a volunteer team and a boat, kept near Havre des Pas. In 1884, the RNLI station in St. Helier was built at Albert Quay, where it still serves as the Island's RNLI headquarters. Images chosen for the Jersey stamps include St Heliers Tamar class lifeboat, the dramatic scenes of the rescue of the yacht Fanny and Sir William Hillary, who founded the RNLI in 1824.Jersey Post said the stamps were a tribute to the ""generations of courageous volunteers and the generosity of those who give to support their vital life-saving work"".The release includes a booklet featuring further information about Jersey RNLI.The stamps will be available to buy from all branches of Jersey Post from 4 March.

Having spent the past five years on the idea, he said support for the project has now gathered. Mr Martyn cofounded the Connect 3 Million campaign, external to build the sub-seabed link in 2019, and the group has been lobbying decision-makers and politicians since.The Faroe Islands to the north of Scotland have a population of about 53,000 and spent hundreds of millions of pounds on a subsea tunnel network.A rail tunnel between Guernsey and France via Jersey would cost an estimated £5.6bn and take up to 10 years to build, according to the campaign group. Mr Dorey said making it easier for people to reach the Channel Islands would ""transform the future for everyone"". ""Our economies are strong but are being held back when we all need them to expand further. ""This innovation will herald a boom across financial services, tourism and beyond”.The roadshows are being held on 5 March in Jersey and 6 March in Guernsey. Speakers due to attend the roadshows include tunnelling experts Arild Sovik, network director of the Norwegian Tunnelling Society and Teitur Samuelsen, chief executive of the Faroe Islands’ public company.Connect 3 Million said the speakers will share  how the economic, social and cultural benefits the tunnels have brought to the Faroe Islands, can be replicated for the Channel Islands.

""When I started, I thought people were going to think certain things about me. But I think it's down to your perception and how you view life. ""If I think that, I come from a more authentic place with my music. ""The album was inspired by the Knife Angel project in Gloucester - a statue made of knives that young people had surrendered. The group made the music for the launch of the sculpture last year, and then went on to make the album.Mikel Medley, youth support manager for The Music Works, said it had been ""life-changing"" for the participants.

Teenagers in Worcestershire told the BBC Politics Midlands programme that home study during lockdown, and increased stress, had left many struggling to cope with school routine.The council said it continued to work to support pupils and parents and ""remove any barriers"" preventing attendance.Overall attendance in the autumn had been up on last year, the authority added.At Baxter College in Kidderminster, where there are 900 students, the overall attendance rate remains 4% down on pre-pandemic levels, according to the principal.One pupil there said students were struggling to readjust after the absence enforced by Covid, with one day off easily stretching into more now things were back to normal. “At the start of the week people say ‘oh I’ll just miss the one day’,"" explained Tom, 18, a sixth form student. ""And then we get to Friday and people are like ‘I’ll have a long weekend'.”Tom said he believed home study during lockdowns made many unused to school routine. “Now suddenly everyone’s being told what to do, when you can eat, when you can go home - it’s definitely been a shock,"" he told the programme.Fellow student Katie, 17, added: “School got re-introduced and I felt like people couldn’t be bothered to come back in, because they felt 'if I can do this at home, surely there’s no need'.”Another 17-year-old, Tegan, said: “My attendance has definitely dropped. I feel like I personally don’t mind working from home, and I work better in the evenings."" The number of pupils persistently absent from school in Worcestershire has not returned to pre-pandemic levelsPrincipal Mat Carpenter said the drop-off was more marked in students on free school meals.Attendance was “not just a school problem"", he said, but a matter for support services and parents too. Additionally, the number of pupils missing more than half of school has risen sharply at Baxter College.“Where previously we would have one or two [pupils like that] in the whole school… we’re now looking at up to 6%,” Mr Carpenter said.Baxter College is not unique in the county. With a secondary school population of more than 36,000, an estimated 23.9% - 8,650 students - in Worcestershire have missed at least 10% of school days so far this academic year. Baxter's principal, Mat Carpenter, and the school's wellbeing lead, Stacey Hannan, said schools needed more support to raise attendanceBaxter’s wellbeing lead Stacey Hannan - who is leading efforts to build relationships with families - admitted progress could be slow.“It could take six to eight weeks of home visits, telephone conversations with parents, and meetings,” she explained.She said the long referral waits students faced for mental health support or neurodiversity assessments meant that often schools were limited in the help they could give.“I think the system in both of those areas is creaking”, added Mr Carpenter, calling for substantial investment.Keira, 15, praised the pastoral care offered at Kidderminster & District Youth Trust, and said she did not feel like she was being judged as in schoolFor 15-year-old Keira, who is not currently in mainstream education, “mental health is the main issue"" for being an absentee, along with a lack of support for such challenges.“I started to not go in as often… my mum kept pulling me out because of how bad I was getting,"" she said of her experience.After being referred to Kidderminster & District Youth Trust, she now has a weekly meeting with mentor Maisie Cook, who says she offers an ""open space"" for teenagers to talk about their emotions and education. Speaking generally, Ms Cook said: ""We see a lot of young people who have a lot going on behind closed doors. Covid has been massive. ""Former Schools minister Robin Walker MP said more investment was needed for a rising level of neurodiverse studentsLast year, a cross-party group of MPs called for the government to offer better support for pupils and schools.“I think I’d give them an A for effort, but they’re not there on achievement yet,” said Worcester's Conservative MP Robin Walker, chair of the House of Commons Education Select Committee. Tracey Onslow, cabinet member for education at Worcestershire County Council, said: ""We continue to work closely with education settings across the county to support pupils and parents, and where possible, remove any barriers preventing regular attendance. ""Herefordshire and Worcestershire Health and Care Trust said it was working with schools and said it carried out weekly reviews of absent children.

Kent Wildlife Trust said the mix of longhorns and Sussex cows were welcomed to Scotney Castle, near Tunbridge Wells, on Thursday to create a ""wilder, more biodiverse"" area.Rebecca Rees, the castle's manager, said they were ""thrilled"" to be working with the trust on the initiative.Castle archives show the first Scotney herd was introduced in 1896.The trust said the grounds of the 14th-century castle and Victorian country mansion included a large, wooded estate where the cattle will work alongside an existing flock of sheep to enhance the National Trust's wilder grazing plans for the site.Ms Rees said: ""The diverse features of the 780-acre estate at Scotney makes it a haven for wildlife and our ambition is to help it thrive. ""She added conservation grazing on the SSSI (site of special scientific interest) will result in an increase of habitat that supports the native wildlife of Kent. ""It also continues the heritage of traditional breeds as part of a working estate,"" she added.Alison Ruyter, area manager for Kent Wildlife Trust, said the cattle have an ""exceptional ability"" to clear reeds, willow, young scrub, and bramble. ""They are renowned for their calm temperament and work together to look out for each other, even taking it in turns to look after the calves whilst others sleep and forage,"" she said.Kent Wildlife Trust has more than 800 cattle, sheep, ponies, pigs, and a herd of bison across many of the 90 nature reserves under their management as part of its Wilder Grazing Strategy.Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

It also comes at a time when passengers have faced disruption to services due to strikes by rail workers over the past 18 months.Traditionally, fares are hiked based on July's retail prices index measure of inflation, which in 2023 was 9%, plus an additional 1%.However, the increase in fares has been capped below this rate, and is lower than last year.Regulated fares cover about 45% of fares, including season tickets on most commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities.For example, if the 4.9% increase is applied, an annual season ticket from Brighton to London would jump £275 to £5,891, while one from York to Leeds would go up £135 to £2,899. While some people may have tried to buy their season tickets just before the price rise, here are five tips for getting the cheapest deals at any time of the year.Advance train tickets are usually released up to 12 weeks before your departure date, although some go on sale as far as 24 weeks in advance. These types of tickets are often the cheapest way to travel on the railways if you're happy to go during a fixed time. Sometimes they can be available to buy up to an hour before your journey.Personal finance website Money Saving Expert says that London North Eastern Railway (LNER) often releases advance tickets up to six months ahead for routes from stations north of York to London.Some ticket purchasing apps can send alerts to your phone as soon as tickets for a specified journey go on sale. Split ticketing means you can take the same number of trains you normally would for your journey, but can save money by splitting your journey into multiple tickets between the stations the service stops at on the way.Some websites like Split My Fare and Split Train Tickets do it for you without you having to work it out.Split My Fare says on average, customers save 26% by doing this - although it's not always possible on some journeys. Also, checking to see whether it is cheaper to buy two single tickets rather than a return might save you money. Rail cards can offer discounts when booking, though they cost money to purchase in the first place, so benefit those who travel often.There are several types of rail card available: national, regional, those for students and those for pensioners. For example, the 16-25 Railcard costs £30, is valid for one year and gives you one third off each ticket you buy.More information on the different types of railcard are here.You can get up to a third off the ticket price when travelling in groups of three to nine adults off-peak.The group must be travelling together, and individual rail cards cannot be used when booking a group ticket. Groups of over 10 people can also get discounts - contact the train company directly for those. Group off-peak day travelcards for London are also available, but the origin station on the ticket needs to be in fare zones one to nine.National flexible rail tickets could save passengers hundreds of pounds, says watchdog Transport Focus. The flexible season tickets will allow travel on any eight days in a 28-day period, with no need to select the days of travel in advance. Train companies have also introduced a range of flexible tickets aimed at commuters and workers who have seen their travel patterns change post-pandemic. The Flexi Season ticket will offer a minimum of 20% discount on an equivalent monthly season ticket, according to National Rail.For those making the same journey multiple times in a week regularly, monthly or season tickets can be cheaper. Check with your employer to see if they offer a season ticket loan to help you spread the cost, interest free.Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

Planning permission was granted in 2022 for offices and a café on the neighbouring site of the historic Western Park Open Air School, which fell into disrepair after becoming the target of vandals and arsonists in the 17 years since it closed.That plan was met with a number of objections from the local community.Key concerns about the latest plan include the loss of park land, the loss of the car park, traffic and parking concerns and the harm to wildlife.A handful of supporting comments were also submitted, with those in favour saying it was good the council was doing this on brownfield land and it would help tackle anti-social behaviour to which some said the car park is ""prone"".Planning officers say the proposal has an ""exemplary and innovative design which should be welcomed"" and the new homes would help meet housing needs.In order to create space for the new homes, the Constance Jackson Centre, Parkfield and Club House buildings would be demolished, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Planning officers labelled the loss of the car park ""regrettable"" when it comes to the convenience of park users. However, they said there would still be ""informal"" parking for them along the park's main access road.The applicant will also be requested to make financial contributions towards improvements at Western Park, which includes improving the basketball facilities.Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

""So my family has a real debt of gratitude to your family. ""Mr Bartholomew added: ""My grandmother was 52 and my great aunt was 17 at the time.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze In Barrow-in-Furness, where Myers was born and raised, and where he lived for many years, he is remembered as a ""lovely man"" who always talked up his home town.He had many enduring friendships, including with artist Graham Twyford, whom he met at Barrow Grammar school in 1973.Mr Twyford first met Myers when he sat down next to him in an empty seat in the dining hall. ""Me and another friend, Pete Thompson, rolled up to the dining hall and there's only a couple of seats left, right next to the bald lad,"" he recalls. ""Most other boys sported long Cavalier locks, so he rather stood out. ""Some daft immaturity came over me and I was a bit unsure, as I took my seat next to Dave Myers, the lad with alopecia. ""He was completely welcoming and friendly, and we hit it off with a shared passion for art. ""Here began the lifelong friendship that took us to flat sharing in London to pursue our fine art degrees and all the adventures ahead. ""After school, the pair ended up as flatmates in Peckham, London. When they would travel back to Barrow to visit family and friends, Mr Twyford recalls Myers and Peter Thompson going to the market for fresh food and cooking up a feast for them all. ""Dave and Pete would cook for us until the early hours of the morning, all adventurous dishes,"" he said. ""He was very loveable, full of enthusiasm, the same off-screen as on-screen. ""I loved Dave, he always had some adventurous plan he was going to try. ""He was just full of enthusiasm and a zest for life. ""His favourite memory from their enduring friendship was going to Brixton to a big motorbike warehouse and Myers buying his first ever bike.However, he did not have a licence and Graham had to drive it, with Myers in the sidecar. When Myers got his licence, the pals went on trips back to Cumbria from London.Graham said: ""I remember it was a Cossack Ural 650cc with a sidecar. ""The picture was taken on an early trip up to the Lakes from London in 1978. ""We took it in turns to ride the bike with one helmet between us. ""Cumbria is one of the top culinary destinations outside London, with a total of 16 Michelin Stars across 13 restaurants.Simon Rogan runs L'Enclume restaurant in Cartmel, south Cumbria, which has three stars.He said Myers was a great ambassador for the county and helped grow its culinary reputation. ""He was always shouting from the rooftops about the produce and the people and he had a genuine love for the area,"" Mr Rogan said. ""I think he was proud of the restaurant scene and what was going on in the North West, predominantly in Cumbria. ""Myers also lived in Roa Island for many years.It is just over half a mile (1 km) south of the village of Rampside, at the southern most point of the Furness Peninsula in Westmorland and Furness and has a population of about 100.It is a tight-knit community and friends and neighbours are saddened by his loss, but remember the TV personality fondly.Former neighbour, Ian Honeyman said: ""It's sad news, I knew he'd been ill but I didn't realise it was as serious as that. ""We were both born in Devon Street and we used to joke about which part of the street did we come from, was it the rough end, that kind of thing. ""He never forgot Cumbria and I think he did such marvellous work publicising it, which was great. ""He was a real natural comic and such a lovely guy. ""Even those who did not know him personally were struck by his natural warmth and down to earth nature when they met him in the flesh.During a trip to Glenridding in the Lake District a couple of years ago, Olivia Clarke spotted two big motorbikes in a car park and her hopes were raised that they might belong to her two biking and cooking heroes. She said: ""We had a couple of minutes chat. They weren't filming, they were just on a boys' jolly, having lunch."" Ms Clarke said her overriding memory of the encounter was the pair's chemistry. ""It just stuck with me because their energy, even off-screen, was there, this was well before Dave was ill,"" she said. ""He had this smiley face, this look on him, this swagger and you just knew you could talk to him."" She said Myers' and King's connection was ""spectacular"". ""They didn't just turn the magic on, it was real and they actually finished each other's sentences, like an old married couple or a pair of comfy shoes. ""Malcolm Flynn, who was another one of chef's neighbours when he lived on Roa Island, said he regularly took photographs of the town and sent them to Myers.He said: ""I'd often walked round the park or go on the bridge and take shots for Dave and send them to him. ""If you saw him he would always stop and speak, he always had the time and was always cheerful. ""He was a true Barrovian and we will miss him.

The hearing, which was held between between 21 and 23 February, considered incidents from between 2018 and 2020.Simeon Wallis presented the Nursing and Midwifery Council's case, saying Mr Ainsworth's dishonesty was ""not limited to a single occasion"".Mr Wallis said the former director's actions were serious and effectively an attempt to evade responsibility for situations in which a direct risk of harm to patients had been created by an error of his judgement, even though no harm materialised.The panel said in January 2019 Mr Ainsworth failed to refer a child with sepsis, referred to as Patient A, instead providing the wrong information to the patient's mother and sent them to a pharmacy.Mr Ainsworth did not make a record of the conversation, and falsely reported that Patient's A's rash ""did fade"" and that the patient's mother declined a review, the panel added.In September 2019, the panel said Mr Ainsworth incorrectly interpreted the blood test results of another patient, asking them to attend a repeat blood test ""when they should have been asked to go to A&E immediately"".The trust issued a statement to confirm Mr Ainsworth had resigned from his role as director of strategy and partnerships, saying he ""leaves with our best wishes and we thank him for all that he achieved during his time with the trust"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

""There's a privilege of being able to speak into certain areas and doing that together across communities adds more power to it. ""Although she intends to spend her first few months getting to know the whole diocese, she said she was looking forward to being based at Peterborough Cathedral.

64k,50,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help. ""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical.

""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk.

Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people. ""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway. ""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really. ""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme. ""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke. ""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims. ""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said. ""It can leave us unable to be the same person. It is quite devastating. ""Takura added that thanks to the programme, Hanari can now go to the shop and pay for her food without being nervous.

""What he achieved in 33 years, most of us never achieve in 70,"" he said.He says it was important the research got publicised and medical professionals and families see and learn from it.For one family, Karina and Terry Fay, from Essex, screening discovered one of their twins, Matilda, had Noonan syndrome. ""We were told our daughter would never be able to eat solid food, she may be able to walk, but it would be very delayed, and she wouldn't be able to have a normal child's lifestyle,"" said Karina. ""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals. ""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care. ""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.

""On Sunday they took part in a minute's silence at Pollok Country Park for those who died during the pandemic.I remember: Scotland's Covid Memorial was created in the park in 2022 following a campaign by The Herald newspaper.The £250,000 tribute, which is made up of 40 tree supports, was designed by artist and poet Alec Finlay.The structures are designed to mimic a person supporting a tree, to demonstrate the support shown in communities during the global health crisis.Sunday's events include a candlelit vigil at the entrance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, organised by Scottish Covid Bereaved.Ms Devine said the sisters raised the alarm when they couldn't get their mother on the phone and called round to her house.She said: ""They said her temperature was fine and took her to the Royal Infirmary just to check her over. ""But just over an hour later, they were told the mother-of-three was in a critical condition. ""It was end of life, they couldn't save her,"" said Ms McCarron.

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures. She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends. ""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something. ""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said.

Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"". ""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache. ""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free. ""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed. ""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award. ""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you. ""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music. ""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock! ""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle. ""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close. ""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano. ""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit. ""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing]. '""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began. ""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air. ""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it. ""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings. ""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song. ""'So what? ', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time. ""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary. ""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark. ""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said. ""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point. ""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss. ""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said. ""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be. ""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling. ""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.

Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site.

""Les Flack, another member of the group, was worried about what the closure would mean for his wife, who has COPD: ""They're there all the time, the pulmonary team, so she goes there for assessments, blood tests, any specialist stuff.

""I deeply regret it hasn't happened but maybe this is an opportunity to actually get that new provision in the town. ""The ICB said: ""The proposals set out a clear commitment to make sure services at St Peter's Hospital such as blood testing and a majority of out patient appointments, stay local.

""Ms Heslop, who was 41 when she vanished, is known to have left Mr Bane's boat moored off St John - which was under a 22:00 local time Covid curfew - to visit a bar and have dinner on 7 March.After three years without answers, Ms Street, of Ongar, Essex, says she feels ""let down"" by police on the Caribbean tourist hotspot and ""hatred"" for Mr Bane, whom she accuses of not doing enough to help find her daughter. ""I want to bring her home so I know where she is - she deserves that. ""The family now has an investigator, a former Metropolitan Police commander of homicide and serious crime, helping them look into the case.Ms Street, who has previously travelled to the island as part of the search for her daughter, told the paper: ""There's too many things that don't make sense and don't add up. ""She is calling on Mr Bane to provide the police with everything he knows about her daughter's disappearance.Under US law, Mr Bane - the last person known to have seen Miss Heslop and described as a ""person of interest"" by police - can stay silent and officers must show ""probable cause"" to get a search warrant.His lawyer, David Cattie, said in a statement to the newspaper that his client was ""heartbroken"" over Ms Heslop's disappearance. ""We certainly understand and empathise with her mother's pain and frustration. ""Mr Bane called 911 immediately upon waking and finding Sarm was not on board. ""He took his dinghy to shore to meet with Virgin Islands Police Department that night and called the US Coast Guard (USCG) the next day when no-one appeared at his boat.

""Mr Keating, now 76, had spent a year on the frontline of one of the longest and most acrimonious industrial disputes in the country's history. He was among the first men to walk out on strike in March 1984 after learning of the government's plans to shut Cortonwood colliery, near Rotherham, and 19 other pits - some within weeks.More than 140,000 other miners across Britain soon joined them in downing tools. Many went unpaid for 12 months as the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), led by Arthur Scargill, fought to stop a colliery closure programme backed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.During that year, families struggled to afford food, clothe their children and heat their homes. They relied on community donations to survive, with miners' wives running soup kitchens, collecting money and food, and rallying support. ""There was a lot of heartache,"" said ex-miner Terry Cadwallander, whose brother took his own life while on strike. ""But we still had to keep going. ""For those involved, memories of the strike - and the pit closures which followed the union's defeat - remain raw 40 years on.In new interviews with the BBC, former miners, family members, police, journalists and politicians tell the story of the battle which changed Britain and its coalfield communities forever.Warning: contains strong languageIn March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) announced plans to shut 20 pits - which it said were unprofitable - with the loss of at least 20,000 jobs. Workers at Cortonwood colliery in Brampton Bierlow - earmarked to close within weeks - walked out on strike, followed by miners across Yorkshire and other parts of England, Scotland and Wales.As the strike stretched from weeks into months, mining families counted the cost of going unpaid.Miners' families relied on donations from their communities to survive. Wives ran soup kitchens, collected food and money, and held rallies to drum up support.The NUM sent protesters - known as flying pickets - to disrupt and pressure working miners. While most picket lines were relatively peaceful,violence flared between striking miners and police as tensions grew. Officers were drafted in from across the country in a coordinated national policing operation.In June 1984, thousands of miners from across Britain picketed at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in a bid to stop lorries delivering coal and collecting coke for Scunthorpe power plant. On 18 June, tensions reached boiling point. Police in riot gear on mounted horses charged at miners, leading to violent clashes. Ninety-five people were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder. All were later cleared.Arthur Scargill vetoed a national ballot on the strike, allowing regional NUM votes instead. In Nottinghamshire, parts of Derbyshire and North Wales, miners voted against joining the walkout and many carried on working. They were known as ""scabs"" by striking miners, who picketed as they arrived at work. Peter Short, a union official, was among those who worked.After a year on strike, a growing number of miners were choosing to return to work. On 3 March,1984, NUM leaders voted to end the dispute without an agreement with the NCB and instructed members to go back to work.By the end of 1985, 23 pits including Cortonwood had shut. Ninety-seven further closures followed before the coal industry was privatised in 1994. The UK's last deep coal mine shut in 2015.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

From April, the government has promised working parents of two-year-olds in England 15 hours of free care a week.Labour said the commitment was ""in tatters"", describing it as a ""botched pledge without a plan"". Under proposals announced in last year's Budget, the government is rolling out the expansion of free childcare in stages. Working parents of three and four-year-olds are already able to get 30 hours of free childcare. From September, it will be extended to 15 hours for those aged nine months and above. Then from September 2025, the government has pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for all under-fives. However, nurseries and other early years providers have warned they will struggle to meet the expected demand for the scheme. The sector argues that years of underfunding has led to a recruitment and retention crisis, meaning there are not enough staff to deliver the policy. Nurseries have also complained of delays in confirming how much they will be paid to offer free hours. Meanwhile, some parents have reported challenges finding local nurseries offering free hours which have places available. Asked if he could give a guarantee to parents and childcare providers that all the places needed to deliver the pledge would be ready for April, Mr Hunt said the policy amounted to ""the biggest expansion of childcare in a generation"". ""It may mean that we need to employ 40,000 more people in the sector and that's why we're bringing it in stages,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""You'll understand why I don't want to give an absolute guarantee. But am I confident we are delivering this programme and it will be on track for this April? Yes, I am. ""Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused Mr Hunt of ""rushing out"" the commitment ""with no plan to make it happen"". ""Now it's working parents, who in the weeks and months ahead - when they go and try and access those places that have been promised - will discover that they just can't be delivered in the way that he set out,"" she told the programme. She has written to the chancellor to demand the free childcare pledge will be delivered as scheduled and without parents facing extra charges. Asked what provision Labour would guarantee if it wins power, Ms Phillipson said: ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes the Conservatives have made - rushing something out without a plan to make it happen. ""She added her party had commissioned a review of early years by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir David Bell, which she said would look at how to drive up standards and ensure childcare places were available. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said the chancellor needed to address ""the huge challenges facing early years providers"", including by offering sustainable funding rates and removing business rates. ""This is the only way that nurseries can plan for a sustainable future and be able to deliver the increased childcare offer being made to parents,"" she said.Free childcare: Keegan confident of April startCash offer for new childcare workers amid shortageFamilies won't miss out on childcare - ministerWho gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply?

""This is the latest step in my running adventure, both to test my limits and to support a worthwhile charity,"" he said.Mr Dawson said he first took up running again after the Covid-19 lockdowns, ""in order to improve both my fitness and my mental health"". He has now completed more than 110 Parkruns and 10 formal 10km races, ""so a half marathon was logically the next challenge"", he added. ""I started daily 30 minute solo walks during lockdown, mainly to help my weight, I was gradually able to extend this to jogging, then running as the weight came off and my fitness improved. ""My first proper run with other people was the Wimpole Estate Parkrun in July 2021. ""Mr Dawson has joined Cambridge running group, 10K Tourists, which runs 10kms around Cambridge on Wednesday evenings, starting and finishing at various local pubs. ""My advice to anyone starting out on this journey is to go to parkruns if you can and also try to find a local group to run with once a week or so - it really helps. ""Dawn Preston, CamSight head of services, said: ""It is truly inspirational to hear John's challenge, taking on a half marathon at 73 is extremely impressive.

""I looked on the back of the packet at the ingredients and thought they weren't likely to improve your health in a significant way,"" she tells the BBC.Another company, Rheal Superfoods, which was featured on BBC programme Dragon's Den in 2021, claims its daily super greens blend supports digestive health, immune system and ""overall wellness from within"".Free Soul's FS Greens blend also makes similar claims, promising to offer digestion and immunity support through key ingredients such as ashwagandha, golden kiwi and maca.A spokesperson for Athletic Greens told the BBC: ""Our team of scientists and researchers have reviewed thousands of studies as part of the formulation and continuous improvement process for AG1."" The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"".Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing.These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety.Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality. ""She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable."" Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"".She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"".Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"".One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030. ""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC. ""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds.Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose. ""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says. ""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds.Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health.Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"".There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"". ""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds.Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit. ""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds.She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables.Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"". ""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds.She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist.Plant-based diets good for the heartBigger breakfasts better for controlling appetiteVegetables alone not enough to reduce heart riskLiquid diets: Do they work and are they safe? RNLI heritage manager David Weldon said he was ""blown away"" by the display, organised to coincide with the charity's 200th anniversary.Sir William Hillary was living in Douglas and witnessed numerous shipwrecks around the coast when he petitioned for the institution.Sir William founded the RNLI in 1824.All At Sea, at the House of Manannan in Peel, was officially opened by the island's lieutenant governor ahead of the anniversary on 4 March.The project, which was a collaboration between the charity and Manx National Heritage (MHH), features some ""very special"" objects, including the gold medal given to Sir William by the institution for founding it.MNH curator Allison Fox said that was a significant feature because ""we know that it was around the coast of the Isle of Man that the idea was formed"".She added: ""He writes in Douglas in February 1823 that the idea of this national institution 'has only suggested itself to me since my residence on a part of the coast often exposed to the most distressing scenes of misery'. ""To have this illustration of that point in history, when this fantastic thing started, is great to have. ""The medal has been loaned to MNH by the RNLI, but the exhibition also contains items relating to the formation from the Manx National Collections.They include original pamphlets outlining what it should be founded on, including the earliest in which Sir William sets out why an organisation was needed, and what it should be. ""This particular one is a first edition and it's just got 'from the author' written on it, which is a nice touch,"" Ms Fox said.Reflecting on the mixture of the island's role as the birthplace of the lifesaving institution and broader Manx maritime heritage, Mr Weldon said the balance of ""tales of endeavour and shipwreck"" together with its place in the RNLI's history was ""just right"".Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

""It can even be used on fingerprints that are a week old. ""Two different coloured dyes, called LFP-Yellow and LFP-Red, bind selectively with the negatively-charged molecules found in fingerprints, locking the dye molecules in place and emitting a fluorescent glow that can be seen under blue light. ""Having two different colours available means the spray can be used on different coloured surfaces. ""We're hoping to produce more colours in the future. ""The dyes are based on a fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is used extensively by research scientists to visualise biological processes. This means the dyes are biologically compatible and don't interfere with subsequent DNA analysis of the fingerprints.The fine spray prevents splashes that could damage prints, is less messy than a powder and works quickly even on rough surfaces where it is harder to capture fingerprints, such as brick.Dr Luling Wu, also from the University of Bath (UK), said: ""The probes are only weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but emit strong fluorescence once they bind to the fingerprints through the interaction between the probes and fatty acids or amino acids. ""The team is working in collaboration with scientists from Shanghai Normal University, China. Principal investigator, Professor Chusen Huang, said: ""We hope this technology can really improve the detection of evidence at crime scenes. ""We are now collaborating with some companies to make our dyes available for sale. Further work is still ongoing.

Her daughter is a pupil at Ballycraigy Primary and she said she had been relieved by the warm welcome. “Coming to this country was not easy for us,"" she explained. ""We don’t know anyone here and we don’t have any family or anything. ""So for Ballycraigy Primary School to have an inclusion week and for them to make us feel like we are part of the family that is very, very important. And I do not take that for granted.”Nosipho said she had never encountered any issues around her race in Ballycraigy. ""Everyone is embracing us. I am happy here now,"" she said.Nosipho Muzvidziwa moved to Northern Ireland from South Africa  Among the delicacies on offer at the food tasting were Chinese soups, Indian daal and fruits from South America. One of the pupils, Kwabena, also known as KO, brought in some noodles which are popular in Ghanian culture.“My friends absolutely loved the noodles; they’d never tried them before but they were a bit spicy,"" he said.His friend Addison said she had yet to try them, but added ""I think that they are amazing”. Jordan Bone, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was just 15 when she became a quadriplegic in the accident.After battling depression, her beauty videos attracted millions of views on YouTube, but singing had always been her passion. ""It feels incredible to have a song out there in the world,"" she said.Ms Bone was a passenger in a car that rolled into a ditch in 2005. ""When I became conscious I was lying against the roof with the seatbelt wrapped around my neck,"" she said. ""I thought I was going to die. I remember thinking, 'I am 15 years old, I've got so much to do'. ""I began singing Candi Staton's You've Got the Love - and it was probably just a whisper - but it brought me back to the moment. It felt like singing saved me. ""Ms Bone said she realised in that moment that she was paralysed, but she assumed that after spinal surgery life would be ""exactly the same, but in a wheelchair"". ""I didn't realise all the support I would need,"" she said. ""At that time I was starting to get more independence; to have that taken away felt like starting from scratch. ""After a couple of years it really hit me, I became down and I felt quite isolated and excluded - especially as a teenager, as if being a teenager isn't hard enough. ""In time, guided meditations helped her, and she began to post her own positivity videos about beauty and living with a disability. ""You didn't see many people with disability in the beauty world, and I wanted to be one of those people to help make those changes,"" she said.Ms Bone has always loved singing and songwriting, and she has now teamed up with musician Jim Kakes to release ""dream pop"" tune Solid Ground. ""The song is about love, trust and the twists and turns that come with it, the desire and insecurities from past situations and expecting something unhealthy when, surprisingly, it is grounded and safe,"" she said. ""You start from you own ideas and you are making something that everyone can now listen to, so that part of the process feels quite magical, and it feels so special to me. ""I want to keep the momentum going; I am really proud of it and I want to become a stronger songwriter. ""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Got a story?

""The farmers were protesting over the foreign imports of food which the said was damaging British farmingSome bystanders applauded the convoy as it passed through the city.One said: ""I'm here to back British food and British farming, and to ensure that the government know all the supermarkets that are selling imports from Spain should be fighting to support these guys who are having a pretty rough time. ""In a statement, the Defra said: “We firmly back our farmers. ""British farming is at the heart of British trade and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.“We’ve maintained the £2.4 billion annual farming budget which supports farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably and are also looking at ways to further improve fairness in the supply chain and support British farmers and growers, as well as ensuring customers have access to high-quality fresh British products.”The Canterbury protest follows a tractor go-slow demonstration at the port of DoverAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at British Retail Consortium, said: “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers. ""Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce.

""I've been trying to get this job for eight years, constantly grinding, constantly asking to do little slots,"" he said. ""No-one is given a job here because their mum or dad helped them into it. You have to earn your colours."" Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club. ""North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication. ""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said. ""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them. ""Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online. ""Someone commented, 'I think Jamie Laing's a really great guy', and someone wrote underneath saying, 'What planet are you on? Is there oxygen?' That's actually quite funny,"" he said.Laing previously co-hosted the Radio 1 podcast 6 Degrees from Jamie and Spencer and also presents the NewlyWeds podcast alongside his wife Sophie Habboo, another Made in Chelsea star.North is to replace Roman Kemp as host of Capital Radio's breakfast show.He had presented the drivetime show with Hope since 2021, having previously presented weekend shows like Greatest Hits on Sundays.He also co-hosts the popular Help I Sexted My Boss podcast with William Hanson.In 2020, he took part in I'm a Celebrity...

Insp Thomson also urged anyone with private CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.The bin lorry driver was not injured in the incident, which happened near the junction with Braehead Road.Thomas is the second child to be killed after being hit by a bin lorry in Scotland this year.Last month an 11-year-old girl died in hospital in Edinburgh a week after she was critically injured in the Borders.Elizabeth Bell was struck by a vehicle on the A6105, near East Gordon, on 31 January.Boy, aged 11, dies after being hit by bin lorryContact Police Scotland One video, which has had millions of views, shows the mysterious figure appearing from behind a mirror to whimpering children.But now The Unknown has been unmasked as 16-year-old Felicia, from Glasgow.And she is thrilled her first paid acting job has gone viral.The villain was met with confusion worldwide as The Unknown was noticeably absent from the plot of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Felicia told BBC Scotland News: ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""In the lead up to last month's event the organisers, House of Illuminati, advertised a ""journey filled with wondrous creations"".Willy Wonka was a fictional chocolatier who ran a competition for lucky finders of a golden ticket to visit his factory.But visitors who hoped to relive the classic book and movies - including the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder - were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at a sparsely-decorated warehouse.The event was held last weekend in an industrial estate in Whiteinch, where actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a small bouncy castle.Children were offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans on their trip to the imaginary sweet factory.Parents paid up to £35 a ticket but were so appalled they called Police Scotland. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.According to the script, which is said to be the result of artificial intelligence, The Unknown was an evil rival chocolate maker who lives in walls.The story involves his attempt to steal Willy's ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"".Felicia was originally cast in the starring role of Willy McDuff - seemingly inspired by Willy Wonka - before opting for The Unknown.A video of the villain, dressed in a silver mask and black cloak, emerging from behind a mirror to unhappy children took off on social media last week.The teenager said: ""There weren't any rehearsals. I got there early to practise but it hadn't been set up. ""The actors came up later and it still hadn't been set up. ""We were all saying it was a mess and there hadn't been any organisation, but we were just hoping that together it wouldn't be that bad. But it was. ""The actors were told to improvise on the day, so Felicia waited behind the mirror for each of the three Willy McDuff characters to pass through with their group.She said: ""My character didn't make any sense without the Wonka explaining who I was, that I was The Unknown, an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls. ""So I was just sitting behind the mirror trying to act creepy because that was the only direction I was given. ""It was definitely a mixed bag of reactions. Some people loved it, some people were terrified of it. ""But I think most people didn't really know what I was there for - which was the same for me. ""Felicia said her concerns about the performance intensified just 45 minutes after the doors opened.She recalled: ""The first few runs were actually working quite well because there was order in it. ""But people were straggling in and then it was just all going wrong. ""In the room next to the mirror, one of the Wonkas had been in there for like an hour straight and he hadn't left and the other two Wonkas had just disappeared. ""During that time more people were coming along and it would build up and build up. ""I was sitting behind the mirror texting my mum saying it was going so wrong. ""Felicia said each Wonka led a group of about 60 people and often they could not all fit in one room.She added: ""One of the other Wonkas made up a storyline that if the children pulled a silly face at me, I would be scared and hide back in my corner. ""That worked really well and it would kind of make sense with the plot. ""But that didn't happen every time so sometimes I just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner. ""Felicia revealed she still has the costume from the event and said it was ""quite funny"" that people had been asking for it.After the experience was shut down, the actors went to the pub for a debrief.She recalled: ""When we came back it was just a big massive mob outside. ""There were like four police cars outside. It was really crazy. ""But despite the backlash, Felicia said the response had been positive on the whole.She added: ""At first I was really embarrassed about it. But when we went to the pub after, we were just laughing about it. ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""And now it's become viral, it's genuinely life-changing and I'm really happy I did it. ""Everybody loves the character and posting about it, so it makes me happy that people can see the funny side."" Doctor's had described Elijah, from Pontypridd, as a medical ""mystery"" and were unable to explain his constant illness prior his diagnosis.Chloe Jones, Elijah's mum and also a nurse, said he has ""never gone longer than two weeks"" without becoming ill.Elijah is now in need of a bone marrow transplant and his family are urging people to help them find a match.Chloe said she first began to piece together why Elijah had been in and out of hospital for almost 18 months, while giving him a bath. ""I noticed there were quite a few bruises going along his spine… then I noticed his mouth and his tongue and lips had all of these blood spots and they looked like blisters,"" she said. She and her partner Rhys began to consider that low levels of blood platelets - cells which help prevent bleeding - could be affecting Elijah's health.After a 10-day stay in the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, Elijah was diagnosed with genetic condition Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood cancer which affects young children.In just 12 weeks, Elijah had developed tonsillitis, croup, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, and an ear infection. ""If he just had a common cold it would lead to something else, it would be sickness, he would be off his food... and then it would be something else - it was just constant,"" said Chloe.Chemotherapy is not as effective for treating Elijah's condition, as JMML is not an active cancer, lying  dormant until patients become unwell.Elijah requires a bone marrow transplant, where healthy stem cells are implanted into the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy cells.His family are now appealing for people to sign up to the stem cell register, in order to give Elijah the best chance of finding a donor match.Elijah's appeal has received the support of blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as well as a number of celebrities and sports stars. A social media post from Chloe to update friends and family about her son's progress was shared by far and wide, including by former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp.Chloe said she and Rhys had been trying to keep Elijah's life as normal as possible, by doing a lot of outdoor activities such as walks and trips to the park, but his life has become limited. ""We've taken him out of childcare, to just try and eliminate any risk of him getting any kind of illness at childcare, soft plays, anywhere like that is a 'no go' zone,"" she said. Speaking ahead of his second birthday celebrations, Chloe said it had been ""really hard"" to make any plans. ""I can't guarantee what the weather is going to be like, I can't plan anything, so no plans yet. Hopefully we can just go for a walk or to the park. As much as I love Wales it is quite tough. ""Despite his health troubles, Chloe says Elijah hasn't let his condition slow him down, and that ""you wouldn't think anything was wrong if you saw him"". ""Even when he was really unwell and he was in hospital he was still running up and down the corridors, going into the other children's rooms, pinching chocolates and snacks... he is definitely a little soldier."" Chloe said it had been helpful to finally have some answers for Elijah's health problems, and to have the support of parents of other children her son had been in hospital with. In an appeal for people to add their name to the stem cell register, she said: ""You don't know how much it's needed until you see it first hand and it's such a simple thing to do to donate your bone marrow. ""It's absolutely life changing for those who need it and there are so many people who do need it, and there's not enough people on the register. ""It's so simple to get on the register, if you're already donating blood or platelets, it's just a tick box, and if you're not, it's just a mouth swab. It's so simple, and if you get called up you're potentially saving a life.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze Here, Nadiya reflects on how her childhood shaped her - ending with the words she composed for her 13-year-old. From the moment she was born, I realised I was not prepared to bring a daughter into this world who would ever think that she was less than anyone else.She is my youngest child. I have two sons as well - they are 16 and 17.I knew growing up as brown Muslim boys would be hard for them both - but they have not had to deal with the hurdles and challenges facing my daughter. There is an affirmation that I've taught them all - but especially her: ""Elbows out."" You need to make space for yourself wherever you go.Now she is a teenager, I don't want my daughter to lose the big dreams and bold ambitions that I lost as a girl.At school, in Luton in the early 1990s, I remember learning about world leaders in history. ""That's what I want to be,"" I thought. ""I'm going to become prime minister."" But then somebody would say: ""Well, have you ever seen a brown prime minister?"" And that particular dream would be squashed.It makes you think how far we have come today.As I approached the age my daughter is now, Nadiya the dreamer was disappearing. I could see that the path ahead of me was to be different to that of my brothers. There was a hierarchy in my family - and men were always at the top. My brothers had freedom, they could socialise, and they could get an education. Although I worked hard in my A-levels and wanted to go to university, my mum told me there was absolutely no way. ""You're a girl, you need to get married,"" she said. I felt as though the person who once had been so lively was disappearing. But now, when I look back, I am proud of who I have become. I think my children are too.Dear Daughter: Elbows out with Nadiya HussainListen on BBC SoundsWhen I was a little girl, I never saw anyone like me on a TV cookery show. OK, I might not be prime minister, but thanks to my passion for baking, I have become a British Bangladeshi in the public eye. Baking built my confidence and helped me cope with my anxiety - I have PTSD and panic disorder. It helped me make connections with people, through the sharing of food.Maybe the big dreams of Nadiya, the little girl, weren't so unrealistic after all.Both my daughter and eldest son love baking. My second son does the dishes. My husband on the other hand is a terrible cook. Once, as he was boiling eggs, they exploded and hit the ceiling.My daughter is very smart, conscientious and kind. She rolls her eyes sometimes when I give her advice - but I know she is really listening deep down.When I sent this letter to my daughter on her phone, she asked if we could frame it and put it in her room. ""Absolutely, we'll frame it,"" I said. I never want to lose our lines of communication.This is your Ma, though when I speak, I know you do not listen. Not really. You shrug. You dismiss, you reel in disgust, as I suggest that I may know better. You look at me and all you see is your mother. The Woman, the person you have known your whole life.You see what is stood in front of you, though often bedraggled. I am here. I am your mother. That is all you see. Not the person that came before her. Let me tell you a little bit about that little girl.That girl, well, she was nothing like your mother. This girl, she was wild. She had great thoughts and even greater dreams. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She spoke about how she felt. She spoke about change. She preached about fairness. Even at her tender age. She knew where she wanted to be. Despite the blockades that life had in store for her.Sometimes I daydream and wonder where that little girl went. How did she disappear out of plain sight so fast? Then I look at you and realise you are that little girl. Same, but entirely different. Fierce, bold and bright, like your mother before you.This is your Ma. Though even when I speak, I know you do not listen. Just know that the little girl inside me that I once was, and I once lost, is holding your hand. And we won't lose another little girl ever again. Let your fire always be fierce. May your purpose guide you. Be the brightest shining light.Baking the Queen's birthday cake More than 4,500 people work at Asos's distribution centre in Grimethorpe - more than that who live in the former south Wales mining village of Maerdy.How well they've responded to losing their mine, the old village heartbeat, depends on your barometer of success.Is getting bigger better, or is it all about a tight-knit community spirit?A quarter of the Welsh population live in former coalfield communities and near the head of the Rhondda Valley in Maerdy, there's a few shops, takeaways, a pub and one road in and one road out. The special magic Helsinki number is 3348603 On a busy day, it can take almost two-and-a-half hours on public transport to get the nearest big city, so locals say people have to move away from their community to get work.Roads, railway lines and more importantly industry - or jobs  - never arrived after the pit shut in 1990, five years after miners went back to work following the miners' strike. ""Lots of things were promised, but not a lot of things came to the valley,"" said Dawn Wood, who was deputy head at Maerdy Primary for 45 years, including during the strike. ""That is a condemnation of any government, whether it's Labour, Conservative, every government. I cannot blame one more than the other. ""Coal has been at the heart of everything in Maerdy for more than 100 years - livelihoods, the social and sporting scene. The mine was the community.When miners marched back to work at the local mine in 1985 after the strike, it was the beginning of the end for coal mining in the village.The town walked in lockstep with the miners, accompanied by a brass band, but within five years the pit was gone for good - and Dawn, now in her 60s, reckons the village's fortunes have steadily declined. ""It is the lack of foresight, they promise things but they don't put it in,"" said Dawn. ""So as far as I'm concerned it is not the people that have let the valleys down, it is governments that have let the valleys down. ""Dawn isn't alone as a new BBC survey suggests three in five people said closing the pits had a negative impact on their area - and almost three-quarters polled said they'd seen little or no regeneration. ""Shops have closed, everybody had to go out of the valley to work... It's all gone, it's not the same,"" said lifelong Maerdy resident Phil Pugh.There is also more deprivation, higher unemployment and poorer health, and new research estimates nearly 20% of people are out of work in the village deep in the Rhondda Fach Valley. ""We haven't got a train, they promised a new road that was supposed to come all the way up to Maerdy, but it only came up as far as Pontygwaith,"" said Gill Owen and Trina Coombs, who join the Knit and Natter group in Maerdy every Tuesday. ""You've got one road in and one road out. Big businesses will not come up here, because of the cost of their travelling time. If there's an accident, you can't get out. ""Last year the workmens' club in Tylorstown got burnt down. We were stuck for four days. ""While the last four decades haven't been kind to Maerdy, some former coalfield communities have flourished.Miners in the Yorkshire village Grimethorpe in south Yorkshire marched back to work around the same time as those in Maerdy, also accompanied by their own brass band made famous by the Ewan McGregor film Brassed Off.Grimethorpe's pit shut in 1993 - and within a year the village near Barnsley was considered the poorest in the UK with half the workforce unemployed. ""Let's be blunt, the government walked away - it devastated that community and said goodbye... and in a sense everything just imploded,"" said Sir Stephen Houghton, head of the multi-agency Grimethorpe Regeneration Board.This video can not be playedThe story of the miners' strikes in Wales in 1984 and 1985""This wasn't miners losing a few jobs, they lost a whole way of life. Everything disappeared overnight. Society in the village started to break down. Crime and disorder went through the roof. ""But a £100m injection built new roads, attracted industry including international fashion retailer Asos, and Grimethorpe - about halfway between Leeds and Sheffield - has grown. ""We had to show the people of Grimethorpe, that somebody cared about them and would work with them, and try and find funds, to try and turn the thing around,"" added Sir Stephen, now Barnsley council leader.Grimethorpe grew - the fortunes of the village and those who lived there changed - but not everyone benefited. ""The new road opened up a lot of possibilities,"" said internationally-renowned dance artist Gary Clarke, who is was born and bred in Grimethorpe. ""It's also brought a lot of new people into the village. I don't want to paint a picture like it's all a bed of roses. It's definitely not. The scars still run very deep in Grimethorpe. ""You can see the division between the old community and some of the newer people that come into the village. What brings people together in Grimethorpe is the legacy of the place. ""A lot of the newer people don't necessarily know the history that Grimethorpe is built on and so with that I think they don't have that community spirit. The soul of Grimethorpe's changed dramatically, but we are trying our best to bring those two sides together. ""It's the opposite back in Maerdy. While some may think they have nothing, others feel having each other is everything - a community spirit that many villages yearn for. ""Open your door, and there's always somebody who'd do you a favour"", says Karen Knott, enjoying a weekly catch-up at Knit and Natter. ""If you were ill, they'd post you a letter, get you a pint of milk - they'd still do it now. My husband was putting an old bike in the car the other day, and somebody came along and asked if he needed any help. ""The current head at the local school likens the current cost of living crisis to the strike in the 80s - and she feels it was community that got people through then, and it will be community that will get people through now. ""During the strike people stood together and helped each other,"" said Maerdy primary head Helen Gregory. ""Today with the financial climate that we're in, people need help as they did back then and we still have people standing side by side helping each other. ""If you go out and about in Maerdy people know each other, people care about each other. There are not many jobs in Maerdy - but we're proud to live here. ""Welsh miners in Ukraine to repay 1984 strike helpHow did the miners' strike affect Wales?Voices from the 1984 miners' strike They have been organised by the Memory Stones of Love group, which was set up by families wanting to remember their loved ones together.Events are taking place across the UK on Sunday to remember lives lost as part of a national day of reflection.In Londonderry bereaved families took part in a walk across the Peace Bridge.A minute's silence was then held in the city's Peace Flame Garden.Ciaran Ward's parents Bredge and Owen Ward, from Strabane, County Tyrone, died within 12 hours of each other in November 2020. ""Today is a special day for all of the bereaved families to come together to grieve together to remember their loved ones,"" Mr Ward told BBC News NI. ""For myself, during the pandemic to lose Mum and Dad, it feels surreal, it still doesn't feel real. ""Mr Ward recalled being unable to visit his parents in hospital due to the strict measures put in place at the time to reduce transmission of the Covid-19 virus. ""Not being able to see them - everyone in life wants to be with their family as they pass away,"" he said. ""And they also want to be at home. And for us, for Mum and Dad - they were denied that. ""He added: ""It's important that as a collective society that we all come together and we remember the horror that has happened and the trauma that has happened for so many people. ""Catriona Myles's father Gerry McLarnon was 67 when he died during the pandemic. She recalled how her dad, who suffered from cancer, died without family members present when he was admitted to hospital in December 2020 after contracting Covid.The annual day of reflection is ""so important for the families"", she said.She said she was at Sunday's event ""to bring comfort, compassion and solidarity to other families that have faced the same losses as ourselves"". ""Everyone wants to move on and I understand that as a society we need to move on but, for the families, there are so many questions unanswered,"" she added. ""And it's a very lonely place that we're in a lot of the time. ""Families also attended events in Belfast and Enniskillen to remember those who died. In Belfast Memory Stones of Love organised a the craft event, from which bereaved family members planned to walk together to Belfast City Hall, which will be lit up yellow in memory of those who died.Last year the group laid more than 300 memory stones in the shape of a heart outside City Hall.The stones were individually painted and bore the name of a loved one who died in the pandemic.Other public buildings across Northern Ireland, including the Guildhall in Derry, will also be illuminated yellow on Sunday evening as a mark of respect. Covid bereaved gather to remember lost loved onesCouple dies 12 hours apart with Covid-19Politicians lack humanity, Covid daughter says ""It was mental,"" said Meg and Charlie, both 29, who live in Swansea. James gifted the couple the tickets for the show, which took place at London's O2 Arena, as an engagement present.The DJ also spent the night itself at the couple's home in Swansea, babysitting their daughter, Maisie, seven - where he got his nails painted. ""Maisie absolutely loved it,"" said Meg, who's originally from Pontypridd, joking that James had a ""similar mindset of age"" to their daughter. James appeared to enjoy himself as well, posting a picture of him playing with Maisie's doll house, as well as a video of them together at the park. He also posted a list of chores Maisie had given him, which included washing the dishes with pink gloves, reading time, and salon time.A photo posted later in the night showed James with a set of pink nails. The relationship between the couple and the DJ started when Charlie appeared on a segment of James' show called What's my Age Again, and ""stupidly"" got his own age wrong. It developed from there, with both Charlie and Meg appearing on the show, both individually and together, in the last few months. They appeared again on Friday and were expecting to take part in a ""Mr and Mrs"" style quiz, which Meg said she had researched for. ""But it was a complete ploy - they told us the truth, that they wanted us to swap lives,"" she said. James said he had attended the show before, and wanted to give away his and his wife's tickets. He offered to babysit the couple's daughter, and on Saturday Meg and Charlie travelled to London where they were put up in a hotel. ""The only thing we had to worry about what was finding something to wear,"" Meg said.They said they had an ""amazing time"" at the show, with seats close to the stage, and indulged in a fair amount of celeb-spotting. They were also full of praise for James, describing him as a ""selfless"" and ""genuine person"". Meg is a maternity worker for the NHS, and Charlie a field technician for an advertising company, and the couple joked they had a ""very romantic story"" of meeting online. Meg is originally from Pontypridd and Charlie from Essex, and James has described the couple as ""a real life Gavin and Stacey"". ""To be honest, we're more like Nessa and Smithy,"" said Meg, referring to the characters played by James Corden and Ruth Jones. ""We like KFC too much."" It was a night out the television characters would likely have embraced. ""We were back by 2am. We ended the night with a McDonald's - that's our kind of night,"" Meg said. Raye makes history by winning six Brit AwardsWho won what at the Brit Awards - the full listBrit Awards 2024: The real winners and losers Jo Hamilton was falsely accused of stealing £36,000 from a Post Office in South Warnborough, Hampshire. On stage at the ceremony, she called for compensation to be sped up for those wrongfully prosecuted.She was joined by the actress who played her in ITV's Mr Bates vs The Post Office, Monica Dolan.The hit drama has been credited with creating mass public interest in the scandal.Mrs Hamilton, 66, told the crowd at the O2 Arena: ""I want to thank everyone in the country for the love and the support they have given the postmasters.

Researchers at the University of Surrey taught an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict the 3D pose from a 2D image of a dog.A myriad of virtual dogs were created using the video game Grand Theft Auto.Postgraduate research student Moira Shooter said: ""From ecology to animation, this neat solution has so many possible uses. ""One way to teach AI to get 3D information from 2D images is to show it photos while giving it information about 3D 'ground truth' - where the objects are in 3D space.For humans, that means wearing motion capture suits. Unable to replicate the same with dogs, researchers altered the code of Grand Theft Auto V, switching the main character for one of eight breeds of dog - a process known as modding.They generated 118 videos of the dogs sitting, walking, barking and running in a range of different weather and lighting conditions. The team called their new database DigiDogs, which was made up of 27,900 frames.They now plan to fine tune the system using Meta's DINOv2 model to make sure it can predict a 3D pose just as well from real dog pictures. ""Our model was trained on CGI dogs, but we were able to use it to make 3D skeletal models from photographs of real animals,"" Ms Shooter said. ""That could let conservationists spot injured wildlife, or help artists create more realistic animals in the metaverse. She added: ""3D poses contain so much more information than 2D photographs.

The Wylye Chalk Stream Project involves farmers, the Wessex Rivers Trust (WRT) and the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust (WWT).Alice Eley, WWT's water team manager, said: ""They [chalk streams] support very unique biodiversity. ""The project, which Ms Eley said is of an ""unprecedented"" scale, has been funded by the government's Landscape Recovery scheme.Some of the wildlife supported by chalk streams and rivers in Wiltshire, such as in the Wylye Valley and Salisbury Plain, include salmon, brown trout, otters and water voles. Chalk streams come straight from the aquifer, a type of rock or sediment which holds groundwater, with the water filtered through the chalk, giving it unique features like a neutral temperature all year round.Ms Eley said the conditions helped certain plants to thrive, such as water crowfoot (Ranunculus), ""which is what these rivers are designated for,"" she added. ""They [chalk streams] react very strongly to pollution. A small water quality change can have a devastating impact on chalk streams,"" Ms Eley said.Josh Stratton is one of the group of farmers in the area involved in the project - they want to return the river to it's natural course and closer to the environment that it would have enjoyed a century or two ago.On one stretch, he has put in gravel to make it shallow in parts, but also made deeper areas, as well as sections that are fast or slow-flowing.Changes like this provide a larger variety of habitats for wildlife, including improving conditions for fish spawning. ""This land is almost post-agricultural so my tonnes per hectare of water voles will be increasing not my tonnes per hectare of wheat,"" explained Mr Stratton.He said he is excited about the project and pleased that the government has put in a framework, but said the science helps too: ""Having real scientists to make it work for farmers has helped. You can't expect farmers to do that in isolation. ""The Wylye Chalk Stream Project is one of 34 successful schemes to come from the Landscape Recovery fund.Ms Eley said: ""Farmers are almost the lifeblood of the river - all of our rivers go through farmland. ""We want farmers to give rivers space - to grow, move, flood out, to do all the things a natural river should do.

Harri Barker has helped to bring saunas to the GowerThey are more commonly spotted in the corners of gyms and luxury hotels - but saunas are starting to pop up on the Welsh coast.Swansea's Gower peninsula in winter may seem like a strange place to relax in your swimsuit, but more and more people are visiting, keen to chase away the rainy day blues.It is the Scandinavian model being followed - where people can move from the cold of the sea, quickly to the warm. The British Sauna society (BSS) was set up almost 10 years ago with a focus on bringing the authentic sauna to the UK, and said numbers have doubled, with an increasing amount outside.It believes these could potentially replace pubs and community centres which are closing - but what is the appeal?‘’It is time away from your phone, time away from the rush of everyday life,"" Harri Barker told BBC Wales Live. ""It kind of brings you back to earth a little bit.’’ She set up Ty Sawna on the Gower in 2022, with one of they reasons being its connection to nature. ‘’That is what it's all about,’’ she added.‘’It can be sunny, raining, snowing or stormy, but you just sit in the sauna and it's like a portal that takes you somewhere else.’""It’s an activity which encourages others to get outside during the winter season. ‘’When a lot of people find it really difficult to cope over the colder months, it’s a way to get people out and meeting new people.’’Scotland’s new wild sauna culture. Video, 00:01:53Scotland’s new wild sauna cultureBoxing Day swimmers fear sewage in seaWith two saunas at Oxwich Bay, Harri is on the sands at 06:00 most mornings during the winter, stoking the fire and setting up.Regular visitors include a group of cold water swimmers, and she said the combination of the hot and cold immersion keeps people coming back. ‘’There is no feeling quite like it,"" Harri said.‘’It's just this buzz that you get, this natural high.’’It may be cold outside, but it is relaxing inside with a sea viewSecretary of the BSS Gabrielle Reason said there is a real difference between these saunas and the ones commonly seen in the UK. ‘’The normal ones tend to be in the corner of a gym or in a hotel,"" she said.‘’People will sit in there, they'll get hot, uncomfortable and think 'that's enough'.‘’A lot of time if you go into a badly built sauna you don’t even access the benefits.’’She explained that the Finnish and Scandinavian style involves a more cyclical approach to the activity - moving from hot to cold and repeating this for up to an hour and a half.Gabrielle said that some research suggests this traditional sauna experience could be good for our physical health. ‘’We are doing some of the same things for our body that exercise would do,"" she added.Gabrielle added some people have suggested it is like going into a therapy room, adding: ‘’When you look at what has been happening in the UK - the closing of pubs and community centres - I think it has potential to actually start replacing those things.’’Could saunas appear in more locations around the coast?‘’I would say the biggest benefit is a reduction in blood pressure,"" said Dr Tom Cullen, an assistant professor in Applied Physiology at Coventry University.‘’It’s particularly important in a Western society, where we're typically highly stressed and often have a poor diet.‘’You also see large improvements to vascular function as well.’’He has been studying the impact of heat therapy and the health benefits it can have, but stressed it cannot replace exercise.‘’If you compare things like weight loss, which is a real goal of lots of people that exercise, for example, you're not likely to see much benefit,"" Dr Cullen added.Ryan Stephens says you can meet people from all walks of lifeRyan Stephens is the founder of sea dipping group, the Wet Bandits, who are one of the regular visitors to Ty Sawna. ‘’The conversations you end up having in the sauna tend to be really deep, meaningful and are usually focused on health and wellbeing,’’ he said.‘’You meet people from all different walks of life. ''It breaks down barriers and allows people to connect at a really genuine level. ''It has become a favourite hobby of Oliver Bailey’It's so different compared to going to the pub or even going for a walk in the park,"" said cold dipper Oliver Bailey.‘’It really stands out. It's just wild.’’While Ty Sawna and many other outdoor saunas are currently on the coast, the BSS sees no reason why they cannot spread to other locations.‘’We want people to see this as a health activity like going to the gym or going to a yoga lesson,’’ secretary Gabrielle said.‘’I think a lot of the saunas cropping up have attracted white, middle class people but there's definitely people who are looking to push that.’‘’There are projects looking at getting social prescribers to start recommending it as a preventative health measure.’’https://www.britishsaunasociety.org.uk/https://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/ Pen-y-Bont in Abergele, Conwy, was relaunched on St David's Day after refurbishment, with what some called a ""slapdash translation"" of its name. The Bridge Head is now displayed prominently on signs, with its Welsh-language name appearing in smaller writing below.The BBC has contacted the owners to respond. ""It disparages the Welsh language... this is some kind of slapdash translation, which is unacceptable,"" said local Dylan Rhys Jones. ""You have the English translation in big letters and the Welsh name in small letters underneath. ""I don't see the reason why they need to change the name. ""Gareth Bolton, who also lives nearby, said the decision to ""rebrand the pub"" had attracted a lot of attention from local residents on social media.He said he was in favour of empty buildings being brought back to life but not ""mindlessly changing names from Welsh to English"".He pointed to another example - Y Gwindy being changed to The Winery, adding: ""At the end of the 19th century, Abergele had 16 pubs, all of them with an English name apart from Pen-Y-Bont and the Gwindy. ""The names of these institutions are woven into local culture, identity and history. ""The savage act of erasing our language is atrocious. ""Language use has divided opinion, with some saying that where names are similar - such as Treorci/Treorchy or Caerffili/Caerphilly - the Welsh version only could be used.Some national parks have also moved to use Welsh names only, such as Eryri and Bannau Brycheiniog - formerly known as Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons respectively.In Eryri, Llyn Tegid has sometimes been known as Lake Bala, and Llyn Bochlwyd as Lake Australia.Should some place names be written only in Welsh?Translation error directs drivers to 'town egg gas'U-turn on street signs means they will be in Welsh Carwyn Powell said he felt ""stranded"" after Spot the collie disappeared. The Pet Abduction Bill will not apply to Wales as animal welfare is a devolved matter. The Welsh government said to ensure its resources have most impact in delivering its animal welfare plan, Wales will not be included in the bill.Currently, pet theft is classed under the Theft Act, meaning that a stolen pet is treated as inanimate property under the law. The Pet Abduction Bill, brought forward by Conservative MP Anna Firth, will make it a specific offence to abduct a pet in England and Northern Ireland.Under the new legislation, anyone convicted of the offence could face a fine or a maximum of five years in prison.But as animal welfare is a devolved matter, it is up to the Senedd to bring forward similar measures in Wales.Mr Powell's Collie, Spot, went missing in December 2018.Despite an extensive search, Spot has not been seen since. Mr Powell, 58, from Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire, said losing Spot was devastating. ""It's like losing a member of the family,"" he said. ""When we are doing something at home, you know there's somebody missing. When a dog's been stolen, there's no closure at all on it. You don't know what's happened to her. ""Mr Powell said that the law as it stands was not strong enough to tackle pet thefts. ""Something needs to be done about it because people are left just stranded really. There's no assistance coming from anywhere but in England and [Northern] Ireland now, they will have a bit of assistance if this bill goes through Parliament, but in Wales, there's nothing forthcoming. ""A pet theft taskforce was set up following a rise in pet thefts during the pandemic, and an abduction bill was one of its recommendations. Former Welsh Secretary and MP for South Swindon, Sir Robert Buckland, who was a member of that taskforce, said: ""The trouble with the Theft Act is that it deals with property and a lot of people think of pets as more than just property. ""We want families to enjoy the protection of the law and that's why abduction is a much better way of looking at it than treating animals as mere property. ""Sir Robert called on the Welsh government to enact a similar change, and said pet owners in Wales ""should not be put in a different position"" to those in other parts of the UK.Debbie Matthews, co-founder of the Stolen and Missing Pets Alliance, which began calling for reforms to the law a decade ago, said: ""It must be terribly worrying for the people in Wales. ""I know Scotland are putting through a dog theft law, if Wales aren't, does that mean that Wales is going to become the hotspot for taking dogs and cats? ""RSPCA Cymru is concerned that pets in Wales could be targeted more in other parts of the UK. Billie-Jade Thomas of RSPCA Cymru said: ""We hope that the Welsh government will continue to monitor the situation and that the decision that they have made is the result of an evidence-based approach. ""RSPCA Cymru recommends the following measures for owners to safeguard their pets: A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We want all animals to have a good quality life. We are delivering this through our programme of ambitious reforms set out in our animal welfare plan. ""Our focus is on areas which will bring greatest benefit to animal welfare across Wales, including our current consultation on licensing animal welfare establishments, exhibits and activities. ""To ensure our resources have the maximum impact on animal welfare, Wales won't be included in the scope of the Pet Abductions Bill"".More on Politics Wales on BBC One Wales, Sunday, 10:00 GMT, and on iPlayerCat and dog theft set to be made criminal offenceMen who bred puppies in sheds in £300k ring jailedPolice use DNA profiling to stop dog thefts Bedford Borough Council said six buildings have now been repaired along the High Street where new paving was unveiled in 2021.The High Street Heritage Action Zone (HSHAZ) Programme began four years ago.Vincent Decamps, from Maison Le Vôtre, said he chose Bedford over St Albans as the place to open his patisserie and bakery because of the restorative work.He said the renovations to the High Street and Silver Street, where he is based, brought ""uniformity"" and marked a ""new start for Bedford"".When looking for a location ""the first goal was to go to St Albans"", he said, and when he first looked around Bedford it was ""a no, no"". ""The only thing that attracted me to this position was the renovation of the building itself; if it was not restored I would have gone to St Albans, period, simple as that,"" he said.He said he ""took a massive risk"" and the area was now welcoming customers ""who haven't been in Bedford for two, three, four, five and six years"".The restoration programme, which started in January 2020, was a joint project between the council and Historic England, in partnership with Bedford BID and SEMLEP, and had been ""instrumental in preserving and enhancing the historic fabric of Bedford's town centre"", the council said.

""I agree with that and I really hope that Wednesday will see a change in the direction that Jeremy Hunt takes, particularly on investment on capital so we that we can invest in our infrastructure, things like affordable housing. ""Ms Robison added taxes should not be reduced as the UK economy had gone into recession and called for the £1.6bn cut to Scotland's five-year capital budget to be reversed.The Scottish government's budget passed its final vote at Holyrood on Tuesday.Ms Robison said her £59.7bn spending plans would protect frontline services and include funding for a council tax freeze.But opposition parties warned the measures could harm economic growth and they criticised cuts for affordable housing.The finance secretary described the budget as ""really challenging"" and said she had to make ""difficult choices"".And she said the affordable housing cuts were linked to UK government cuts in both capital funding and financial transaction funding.Ms Robison added: ""I have said it is the number one issue that I want to address if I get that additional capital from the Spring Budget on Wednesday. ""She also said the one-year freeze on council tax was an intervention designed to help with household budgets during the cost of living crisis.So far 30 of Scotland's 32 local authorities have set their budgets but only two - Argyll & Bute and Inverclyde - have confirmed they will put taxes up for 2024/25.Ms Robison told The Sunday Show: ""We are providing £210m to local authorities to help them freeze the council tax and we expect that council tax payers get some benefit out of that investment. ""The minister added that, given the current financial climate, she believed local authorities had been ""treated fairly"".Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith later criticised her comments.She said: ""It's ridiculous of Shona Robison to be giving the UK chancellor advice on growth, when the SNP's dire record led to her savage tax-and-axe budget that means Scots will be paying more to receive fewer and worse services. ""It's even more absurd for her to call for housing investment, when she has just cut Scotland's housing budget by 26%, and Shelter Scotland say the SNP are 'gaslighting' the public on the subject. ""Ms Smith also described the handling of the council tax freeze as ""shambolic"".She added: ""Her financial incompetence has left councils so desperate that they are appealing directly to the UK government. ""Meanwhile, Scottish Labour's finance spokesman Daniel Johnson said he was ""very uncomfortable"" with the situation faced by local authorities after the council tax freeze announcement.He told The Sunday Show: ""We had a pledge that was driven by the need to give the first minister a talking point at his conference in the autumn. ""Ever since then they have been playing catch up, leaving our councils in utter chaos. ""Mr Johnson also condemned the decision to put plans on hold to build new hospitals, surgeries and a network of treatment centres in Scotland. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said ahead of the 6 March announcement that there was ""too much waste in the system"".As part of the reforms, AI will be used to cut NHS scan times by a third and the police will deploy drones to incidents such as traffic collisions.Labour said the package amounted to ""spin without substance"".Elsewhere, Mr Hunt also hinted that civil service staff numbers could be cuts by tens of thousands. The Treasury is hoping that the proposed technological reforms will deliver as much as £1.8bn worth of benefits to public sector productivity by 2029. ""There is too much waste in the system and we want public servants to get back to doing what matters most: teaching our children, keeping us safe and treating us when we're sick,"" Mr Hunt said. ""That's why our plan is about reaping the rewards of productivity, from faster access to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for patients to hundreds of thousands of police hours freed up to attend burglaries or incidents of domestic abuse. ""The announcement comes as Mr Hunt is under mounting pressure from his Conservative colleagues to deliver tax cuts when he unveils his Budget on Wednesday.The Treasury said the latest move would mean 130,000 patients a year - including those waiting for cancer results - would receive their completed tests quicker as a result of at least 100 MRI scanners in England being upgraded with AI.In policing, it said the reforms would help to deliver on the Police Productivity Review, which it said found up to 38 million hours of officer time could be saved every year.Other key measures in the £800m investment include:Darren Jones, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Nothing in Britain is better off after 14 years of Conservative economic failure. ""Millions of people are stuck on hospital waiting lists, our schools are crumbling and our streets are less safe. And yet all the chancellor is offering is more spin without substance. ""The BBC's Faisal Islam said the Budget came at a time when the government was hoping to have scope to unveil voter-friendly tax cuts ahead of the general election.It initially hoped for ""headroom"" of about £30bn to spend at the start of the year after its borrowing costs fell sharply, but the BBC understands this figure returned to its November level of roughly £13bn by the middle of last month. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Hunt acknowledged the latest forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility had broadly ""gone against us"". ""So it's going to be a Budget where we stress... the importance of being responsible with the country's finances, because it's fundamentally unconservative to fund all the things that you would like to do by borrowing money for future generations,"" he said. Paul Jonson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC that any tax cut in the Budget was ""likely to be undone after the next election, whoever wins"". He added: ""Whatever the scale of the tax cut announced this week, during this parliament taxes will have risen very substantially indeed. ""Mr Hunt also said the government would look to further cut public sector costs by reducing the number of staff in the civil service back to pre-pandemic levels.According to the Institute for Government, staff levels rose from around 423,000 at the start of 2020 to 496,150 in September last year. ""You had a huge expansion of [the] civil service during the pandemic that was justified,"" the chancellor said. ""It was an exceptional situation, but we're not in a pandemic now.

Curator Fiona Jenkinson said: ""The Georgian period was a time of great agricultural and industrial change, dominated by class, culture and consumerism. ""Fashion, society, and leisure were key to people like John Courtney, who travelled extensively around England and took part in much of the social life of Beverley, York and London,"" she said. ""He also spent much time searching for a suitable wife, and his diary is full of accounts of unrequited love, giving us an insight into romance and courting during that time,"" she added.Reproductions from William Hogarth's moralistic art series will also be on display.Councillor Nick Coultish, East Riding of Yorkshire Council's Cabinet member for culture, leisure and tourism, added: ""This will be a fascinating exhibition, and promises to be a revelation about the Georgian period in Beverley.The exhibition runs until 28 June.Follow BBC East Yorkshire and Lincolnshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

Marco Longhi, a Conservative MP who represents Dudley North in the West Midlands, defended him and said he should not have been suspended from the party. He said there was no evidence his friend was Islamophobic or racist and that he should be re-instated.The Ashfield MP was suspended from the Tory party after he refused to apologise for the remarks, which the prime minister's official spokesperson said were wrong. Mr Longhi told Politics Midlands: ""I think where there might be a slight weakness in his argument is making an assertion that Sadiq Khan is closely associated to Islamist and therefore, by inference, an Islamist himself. ""I think it's right that Lee works this out and I would like to see him return in the Conservative fold as soon as possible."" Lee Anderson has represented Ashfield since 2019Mr Longhi made the remarks during a debate about so-called no-go zones.Another Conservative MP, Paul Scully, apologised last week for suggesting there were ""no-go"" areas in parts of London's Tower Hamlets and Sparkill in Birmingham. The Dudley North MP said those comments were wrong but it did not show the Conservatives were out of touch. Mr Longhi said he represented a diverse community and there was not a corner of the United Kingdom he would personally describe as a no-go zone. ""We know that Britain's diversity is a great strength,"" added Mary Creagh, former MP for Wakefield, and Labour Party candidate for Coventry East. ""We can see good people trying to paper in the cracks that have been left by 14 years of Tory austerity and cuts to public services.""

Mr Hunt is under pressure from some Tory MPs to reduce taxes in Wednesday's Budget, ahead of an election which must be held by the end of January. A further cut to National Insurance is believed to be among the measures being considered by the chancellor.In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Hunt said the Budget, when the government sets out its plans for tax and spending, would be about ""long-term growth"". He said he also hoped to ""show a path"" towards a lower-tax economy. ""We've been very consistent, that we would only cut taxes in a way that was responsible and prudent,"" he said. ""The most unconservative thing I could do would be to cut taxes by increasing borrowing. ""Overall the amount of tax people pay is still on course to reach record levels, despite the main rate of National Insurance being cut from 12% to 10% in last year's Autumn Statement. Mr Hunt has repeatedly hinted that he wants to reduce taxes further in the Budget but in recent weeks he has suggested there is likely to be less scope for this than he had hoped. With only 72 hours until the Budget, Mr Hunt was firmly in the damping down expectations mode.At the start of this year, the government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had estimated the chancellor had about £30bn of ""headroom"" to spend in the Budget, after borrowing costs fell sharply.Since then, borrowing costs have begun to rise again and by the middle of last month, the BBC understands the figure was back to its November level of roughly £13bn.With the government's spending rules and the OBR breathing down his neck on one side, and the Tory backbenches who want the historically high taxes cut, it is not a comfortable position. However, there is wide expectation at Westminster that he will reduce some taxes, even if the moves are not significant. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said: ""The chancellor says he wants to cut taxes, but it is the Tories who have raised taxes to their highest level in 70 years. ""No matter what the chancellor does in the Budget this week, working people will be worse off thanks to 14 years of Tory failure. ""Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, told the BBC that any tax cut in the Budget was ""likely to be undone after the next election, whoever wins"".The IFS has also warned that further reducing taxes is likely to mean spending cuts in the future.Asked if the government should be spending more on public services, rather than tax cuts, Mr Hunt said: ""I think what most people want is better public services and a lower tax burden. ""The only way that we have a chance of delivering something like that is by spending the money that we spend on public services much more efficiently."" The government has already announced an £800m package of reforms aimed at freeing up NHS and police time, for example using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to cut NHS scan times and drones to assess incidents such as traffic collisions.Former chief economist at the Bank of England Andy Haldane told the programme he thought the government's self-imposed spending limits - known as ""fiscal rules"" - were ""stunting"" economic growth and constraining the chancellor's decisions.These include getting debt as a proportion of the size of the economy falling in five years. Mr Hunt said he did not agree the government should change its fiscal rules because ""people would interpret that as Britain losing control of its finances"". Recent memories of the meltdown in the financial markets following Liz Truss's mini-Budget in 2022 - which included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - are a reminder of why such rules exist. But there does seem to be growing disquiet that the system that is meant to guarantee stability can have a negative impact too. Meanwhile, the chancellor is also considering other measures to raise revenue, including a new tax on vapes and scrapping non-dom tax status. People with non-domiciled status are UK residents whose home for tax purposes is abroad. Under the current system, they do not have to pay UK tax on money they make overseas.Mr Hunt has previously defended the tax status, arguing it helps make the UK an attractive place for well-off people to live and work. Labour has pledged to abolish non-dom status and spend the money generated on schools and the NHS. If the party backs any tax cuts the chancellor announces, which they are expected to do, this would leave questions over how some of their spending pledges would be funded.Mr Hunt refused to comment on any potential changes to specific taxes.However, he told the BBC: ""The country sees through gimmicks and we are not going to do gimmicks on Wednesday.

Three Kent pits - Snowdown, Tilmanstone and Betteshanger - were in operation in 1984 when the 54-week dispute began.Protests were held against plans by the National Coal Board, supported by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to shut 20 ""unprofitable"" pits nationwide.The National Union of Miners' strike saw miners and police clash on the picket lines across the country.Eventually the Kent miners returned to work but the pits were destined for closure. Betteshanger was the last to close in Kent in 1989.Shaun Parry started working at Snowdown Colliery near Aylesham when he was just 16 years old. He said: ""It was 940m deep, and it was very, very hot. I think the nickname was Dante's inferno. I loved it. ""Mr Parry said he had been detained by police during the strike. ""I hadn't done anything. I was taken to the van and then they cable-tied you to a wire inside the van,"" he said. ""I was frightened. I was really frightened."" Kay Sutcliffe was married to miner Philip Sutcliffe and they lived in the pit village of Aylesham. She said no-one in the village broke the strike and everyone in Aylesham was ""organised and united"".For Mrs Sutcliffe, the strikes were a battle to save not just jobs, but a way of life. After seeing TV reports of miners' wives in Nottinghamshire calling for a return to work, women in Kent, led by Mrs Sutcliffe and others, travelled north to boost support for the stoppage.She penned poems which galvanized dozens of women to march in protest, while her speeches were heard by thousands. Mrs Sutcliffe said: ""I think we were the first women support group that actually publicly were noticed for doing an active thing like that. ""'How is it gonna affect the miners in our community? How is it gonna affect their families if they can't get a job anywhere?' That's the kind of thing I was talking about,"" she told BBC Politics South East. ""And how much it meant to our communities to keep the pits going, and not just to our communities, but to the whole country."" Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

""Councillor Stephen Philpott, for Peel Common, said he was concerned the grant would be lost if the project did not start this year.The council previously said it was confident work would start in May and be finished in September, protecting the area in time for the winter.Steve Fitzmaurice and Andy Pearce, representing Coastal Partners, gave an update on the Alverstoke, Seafield and Stokes Bay flood defence schemes at the council meeting.They said that while a contractor, West Sussex-based JT Mackley and Co Ltd, had been appointed to start work on flood defence structures at Forton, there was a budget shortfall on the other projects. The Alverstoke sea defences, in the pipeline since 2015, would see the flood risk reduced for 142 homes and businesses. Seafield was also highlighted as one of the three priority areas for a flood defence scheme with 80 homes and businesses at risk, but it has an £800,000 funding gap.Council leader Peter Chegwyn said he wanted the government to provide extra money.Coastal Partners was formed in 2012 to deliver a coastal management service across the coastlines of the local authorities in Havant, Portsmouth, Gosport, Chichester, and Fareham.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Jersey Post said the stamps capture the ""enduring spirit of the RNLI"".A lifeboat was first established in Jersey in 1830, with a volunteer team and a boat, kept near Havre des Pas. In 1884, the RNLI station in St. Helier was built at Albert Quay, where it still serves as the Island's RNLI headquarters. Images chosen for the Jersey stamps include St Heliers Tamar class lifeboat, the dramatic scenes of the rescue of the yacht Fanny and Sir William Hillary, who founded the RNLI in 1824.Jersey Post said the stamps were a tribute to the ""generations of courageous volunteers and the generosity of those who give to support their vital life-saving work"".The release includes a booklet featuring further information about Jersey RNLI.The stamps will be available to buy from all branches of Jersey Post from 4 March.

Having spent the past five years on the idea, he said support for the project has now gathered. Mr Martyn cofounded the Connect 3 Million campaign, external to build the sub-seabed link in 2019, and the group has been lobbying decision-makers and politicians since.The Faroe Islands to the north of Scotland have a population of about 53,000 and spent hundreds of millions of pounds on a subsea tunnel network.A rail tunnel between Guernsey and France via Jersey would cost an estimated £5.6bn and take up to 10 years to build, according to the campaign group. Mr Dorey said making it easier for people to reach the Channel Islands would ""transform the future for everyone"". ""Our economies are strong but are being held back when we all need them to expand further. ""This innovation will herald a boom across financial services, tourism and beyond”.The roadshows are being held on 5 March in Jersey and 6 March in Guernsey. Speakers due to attend the roadshows include tunnelling experts Arild Sovik, network director of the Norwegian Tunnelling Society and Teitur Samuelsen, chief executive of the Faroe Islands’ public company.Connect 3 Million said the speakers will share  how the economic, social and cultural benefits the tunnels have brought to the Faroe Islands, can be replicated for the Channel Islands.

He added: ""One thing I've realised is that the more authentic you are with how you feel about subjects like the Knife Angel - putting knives down and making people aware of the violence that goes on in their city - it makes people want to be more authentic themselves. ""When I started, I thought people were going to think certain things about me. But I think it's down to your perception and how you view life. ""If I think that, I come from a more authentic place with my music. ""The album was inspired by the Knife Angel project in Gloucester - a statue made of knives that young people had surrendered. The group made the music for the launch of the sculpture last year, and then went on to make the album.Mikel Medley, youth support manager for The Music Works, said it had been ""life-changing"" for the participants. ""Some of them have said they wouldn't know where they would be in their life if they wasn't doing music,"" he said. ""They probably would have got themselves into trouble or not be in a good well-being space. ""Coby, who does marketing for the project, said: ""To me, it was really important just because I got to convey a lot of the stuff that isn't spoken about so much. ""I think when it comes to the topic of knife crime we often talk about the fallout of what happens when all of these things come to a head.

Teenagers in Worcestershire told the BBC Politics Midlands programme that home study during lockdown, and increased stress, had left many struggling to cope with school routine.The council said it continued to work to support pupils and parents and ""remove any barriers"" preventing attendance.Overall attendance in the autumn had been up on last year, the authority added.At Baxter College in Kidderminster, where there are 900 students, the overall attendance rate remains 4% down on pre-pandemic levels, according to the principal.One pupil there said students were struggling to readjust after the absence enforced by Covid, with one day off easily stretching into more now things were back to normal. “At the start of the week people say ‘oh I’ll just miss the one day’,"" explained Tom, 18, a sixth form student. ""And then we get to Friday and people are like ‘I’ll have a long weekend'.”Tom said he believed home study during lockdowns made many unused to school routine. “Now suddenly everyone’s being told what to do, when you can eat, when you can go home - it’s definitely been a shock,"" he told the programme.Fellow student Katie, 17, added: “School got re-introduced and I felt like people couldn’t be bothered to come back in, because they felt 'if I can do this at home, surely there’s no need'.”Another 17-year-old, Tegan, said: “My attendance has definitely dropped. I feel like I personally don’t mind working from home, and I work better in the evenings."" The number of pupils persistently absent from school in Worcestershire has not returned to pre-pandemic levelsPrincipal Mat Carpenter said the drop-off was more marked in students on free school meals.Attendance was “not just a school problem"", he said, but a matter for support services and parents too. Additionally, the number of pupils missing more than half of school has risen sharply at Baxter College.“Where previously we would have one or two [pupils like that] in the whole school… we’re now looking at up to 6%,” Mr Carpenter said.Baxter College is not unique in the county. With a secondary school population of more than 36,000, an estimated 23.9% - 8,650 students - in Worcestershire have missed at least 10% of school days so far this academic year. Baxter's principal, Mat Carpenter, and the school's wellbeing lead, Stacey Hannan, said schools needed more support to raise attendanceBaxter’s wellbeing lead Stacey Hannan - who is leading efforts to build relationships with families - admitted progress could be slow.“It could take six to eight weeks of home visits, telephone conversations with parents, and meetings,” she explained.She said the long referral waits students faced for mental health support or neurodiversity assessments meant that often schools were limited in the help they could give.“I think the system in both of those areas is creaking”, added Mr Carpenter, calling for substantial investment.Keira, 15, praised the pastoral care offered at Kidderminster & District Youth Trust, and said she did not feel like she was being judged as in schoolFor 15-year-old Keira, who is not currently in mainstream education, “mental health is the main issue"" for being an absentee, along with a lack of support for such challenges.“I started to not go in as often… my mum kept pulling me out because of how bad I was getting,"" she said of her experience.After being referred to Kidderminster & District Youth Trust, she now has a weekly meeting with mentor Maisie Cook, who says she offers an ""open space"" for teenagers to talk about their emotions and education. Speaking generally, Ms Cook said: ""We see a lot of young people who have a lot going on behind closed doors. Covid has been massive. ""Former Schools minister Robin Walker MP said more investment was needed for a rising level of neurodiverse studentsLast year, a cross-party group of MPs called for the government to offer better support for pupils and schools.“I think I’d give them an A for effort, but they’re not there on achievement yet,” said Worcester's Conservative MP Robin Walker, chair of the House of Commons Education Select Committee. Tracey Onslow, cabinet member for education at Worcestershire County Council, said: ""We continue to work closely with education settings across the county to support pupils and parents, and where possible, remove any barriers preventing regular attendance.

Kent Wildlife Trust said the mix of longhorns and Sussex cows were welcomed to Scotney Castle, near Tunbridge Wells, on Thursday to create a ""wilder, more biodiverse"" area.Rebecca Rees, the castle's manager, said they were ""thrilled"" to be working with the trust on the initiative.Castle archives show the first Scotney herd was introduced in 1896.The trust said the grounds of the 14th-century castle and Victorian country mansion included a large, wooded estate where the cattle will work alongside an existing flock of sheep to enhance the National Trust's wilder grazing plans for the site.Ms Rees said: ""The diverse features of the 780-acre estate at Scotney makes it a haven for wildlife and our ambition is to help it thrive. ""She added conservation grazing on the SSSI (site of special scientific interest) will result in an increase of habitat that supports the native wildlife of Kent. ""It also continues the heritage of traditional breeds as part of a working estate,"" she added.Alison Ruyter, area manager for Kent Wildlife Trust, said the cattle have an ""exceptional ability"" to clear reeds, willow, young scrub, and bramble. ""They are renowned for their calm temperament and work together to look out for each other, even taking it in turns to look after the calves whilst others sleep and forage,"" she said.Kent Wildlife Trust has more than 800 cattle, sheep, ponies, pigs, and a herd of bison across many of the 90 nature reserves under their management as part of its Wilder Grazing Strategy.Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

It also comes at a time when passengers have faced disruption to services due to strikes by rail workers over the past 18 months.Traditionally, fares are hiked based on July's retail prices index measure of inflation, which in 2023 was 9%, plus an additional 1%.However, the increase in fares has been capped below this rate, and is lower than last year.Regulated fares cover about 45% of fares, including season tickets on most commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities.For example, if the 4.9% increase is applied, an annual season ticket from Brighton to London would jump £275 to £5,891, while one from York to Leeds would go up £135 to £2,899. While some people may have tried to buy their season tickets just before the price rise, here are five tips for getting the cheapest deals at any time of the year.Advance train tickets are usually released up to 12 weeks before your departure date, although some go on sale as far as 24 weeks in advance. These types of tickets are often the cheapest way to travel on the railways if you're happy to go during a fixed time. Sometimes they can be available to buy up to an hour before your journey.Personal finance website Money Saving Expert says that London North Eastern Railway (LNER) often releases advance tickets up to six months ahead for routes from stations north of York to London.Some ticket purchasing apps can send alerts to your phone as soon as tickets for a specified journey go on sale. Split ticketing means you can take the same number of trains you normally would for your journey, but can save money by splitting your journey into multiple tickets between the stations the service stops at on the way.Some websites like Split My Fare and Split Train Tickets do it for you without you having to work it out.Split My Fare says on average, customers save 26% by doing this - although it's not always possible on some journeys. Also, checking to see whether it is cheaper to buy two single tickets rather than a return might save you money. Rail cards can offer discounts when booking, though they cost money to purchase in the first place, so benefit those who travel often.There are several types of rail card available: national, regional, those for students and those for pensioners. For example, the 16-25 Railcard costs £30, is valid for one year and gives you one third off each ticket you buy.More information on the different types of railcard are here.You can get up to a third off the ticket price when travelling in groups of three to nine adults off-peak.The group must be travelling together, and individual rail cards cannot be used when booking a group ticket. Groups of over 10 people can also get discounts - contact the train company directly for those. Group off-peak day travelcards for London are also available, but the origin station on the ticket needs to be in fare zones one to nine.National flexible rail tickets could save passengers hundreds of pounds, says watchdog Transport Focus. The flexible season tickets will allow travel on any eight days in a 28-day period, with no need to select the days of travel in advance. Train companies have also introduced a range of flexible tickets aimed at commuters and workers who have seen their travel patterns change post-pandemic. The Flexi Season ticket will offer a minimum of 20% discount on an equivalent monthly season ticket, according to National Rail.For those making the same journey multiple times in a week regularly, monthly or season tickets can be cheaper. Check with your employer to see if they offer a season ticket loan to help you spread the cost, interest free.Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

""We quite often saw parents who delivered their children to school quite early in the morning, sort of trudging home,"" she said. ""We just thought wouldn't it be nice, because the church is still warm after Sunday. It's a space that's not being used on a Monday morning. ""It's not for a religious reason, it's not to have a service. It's just simply to say 'come in and just have a chat with your friends and enjoy a nice cup of coffee'. ""It isn't the first Mr and Mrs Sarson-Rowe, who got married in the church a year ago, have done for the community. Earlier this year they purchased a five-acre field to stop it from being built on, so it could be kept as a community green space. ""People are very positive. It's not a bad way to start a week, "" said Mr Sarson-Rowe""We're also trying to keep the church doors open, so that people know the church is here every day, not just on Sundays. ""Reverend Jane palmer, vicar at Christ Church, said the coffee morning is helping to spread that message.

""So my family has a real debt of gratitude to your family. ""Mr Bartholomew added: ""My grandmother was 52 and my great aunt was 17 at the time. ""They would both have had to climb down the outside of the Suevic on a rope ladder and when it came to the bottom basically jump into the lifeboat.

All 340 people on board lost their lives.The aircraft came down just minutes after take-off from Paris at 12:35 GMT and scythed a mile-long trail through the forest of Ermenonville near the French capital.Among the victims were 200 passengers, many of them British, who had been transferred from British Airways flights cancelled because of a strike by engineers at London airport.

The conservation work began in 2022, which meant one side of the cathedral was hidden by scaffolding. Now it has been taken down and visitors have full access to the garden overlooking the River Wear.The expert team removed stones in bad condition and carved new stones to make them the right shape and size, before securing them into the wall with lime mortar.The Monks' Garden became enclosed when the Galilee Chapel was built in the 12th Century and was used by novice monks in their leisure time.After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th Century, the bowling green became a garden for the clergy.Gary Holliday, stonemason supervisor, said: ""Although it has been a challenging and lengthy process, working in all weather, the most satisfying parts of the project have been in the workshop cutting stones to our templates.

""Me and another friend, Pete Thompson, rolled up to the dining hall and there's only a couple of seats left, right next to the bald lad,"" he recalls. ""Most other boys sported long Cavalier locks, so he rather stood out. ""Some daft immaturity came over me and I was a bit unsure, as I took my seat next to Dave Myers, the lad with alopecia. ""He was completely welcoming and friendly, and we hit it off with a shared passion for art. ""Here began the lifelong friendship that took us to flat sharing in London to pursue our fine art degrees and all the adventures ahead. ""After school, the pair ended up as flatmates in Peckham, London. When they would travel back to Barrow to visit family and friends, Mr Twyford recalls Myers and Peter Thompson going to the market for fresh food and cooking up a feast for them all. ""Dave and Pete would cook for us until the early hours of the morning, all adventurous dishes,"" he said. ""He was very loveable, full of enthusiasm, the same off-screen as on-screen. ""I loved Dave, he always had some adventurous plan he was going to try. ""He was just full of enthusiasm and a zest for life. ""His favourite memory from their enduring friendship was going to Brixton to a big motorbike warehouse and Myers buying his first ever bike.However, he did not have a licence and Graham had to drive it, with Myers in the sidecar. When Myers got his licence, the pals went on trips back to Cumbria from London.Graham said: ""I remember it was a Cossack Ural 650cc with a sidecar. ""The picture was taken on an early trip up to the Lakes from London in 1978. ""We took it in turns to ride the bike with one helmet between us. ""Cumbria is one of the top culinary destinations outside London, with a total of 16 Michelin Stars across 13 restaurants.Simon Rogan runs L'Enclume restaurant in Cartmel, south Cumbria, which has three stars.He said Myers was a great ambassador for the county and helped grow its culinary reputation. ""He was always shouting from the rooftops about the produce and the people and he had a genuine love for the area,"" Mr Rogan said. ""I think he was proud of the restaurant scene and what was going on in the North West, predominantly in Cumbria. ""Myers also lived in Roa Island for many years.It is just over half a mile (1 km) south of the village of Rampside, at the southern most point of the Furness Peninsula in Westmorland and Furness and has a population of about 100.It is a tight-knit community and friends and neighbours are saddened by his loss, but remember the TV personality fondly.Former neighbour, Ian Honeyman said: ""It's sad news, I knew he'd been ill but I didn't realise it was as serious as that. ""We were both born in Devon Street and we used to joke about which part of the street did we come from, was it the rough end, that kind of thing. ""He never forgot Cumbria and I think he did such marvellous work publicising it, which was great. ""He was a real natural comic and such a lovely guy. ""Even those who did not know him personally were struck by his natural warmth and down to earth nature when they met him in the flesh.During a trip to Glenridding in the Lake District a couple of years ago, Olivia Clarke spotted two big motorbikes in a car park and her hopes were raised that they might belong to her two biking and cooking heroes. She said: ""We had a couple of minutes chat. They weren't filming, they were just on a boys' jolly, having lunch."" Ms Clarke said her overriding memory of the encounter was the pair's chemistry. ""It just stuck with me because their energy, even off-screen, was there, this was well before Dave was ill,"" she said. ""He had this smiley face, this look on him, this swagger and you just knew you could talk to him."" She said Myers' and King's connection was ""spectacular"".

64k,75,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age. ""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains.

There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings. ""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits. ""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself. ""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family. ""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave. ""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other. ""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income. ""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore. ""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children. ""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families. """"It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic. ""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance. ""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given. ""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says.

So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty. ""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing. ""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations. ""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom. ""It was really difficult. ""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great. ""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them? ""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do. ""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us. ""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change. ""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended. ""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us. ""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night. ""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical. ""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited. ""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much. ""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives. ""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again. ""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk. ""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life. ""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"". ""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added. ""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right. ""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation. ""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials. ""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit. ""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p. ""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others.

""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said. ""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people. ""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong. ""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway. ""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really. ""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme. ""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke. ""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims. ""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said. ""It can leave us unable to be the same person. It is quite devastating. ""Takura added that thanks to the programme, Hanari can now go to the shop and pay for her food without being nervous. ""This programme made a big difference to how we communicate around the house,"" he said.Follow BBC Bristol on Facebook, X and Instagram.

""What he achieved in 33 years, most of us never achieve in 70,"" he said.He says it was important the research got publicised and medical professionals and families see and learn from it.For one family, Karina and Terry Fay, from Essex, screening discovered one of their twins, Matilda, had Noonan syndrome. ""We were told our daughter would never be able to eat solid food, she may be able to walk, but it would be very delayed, and she wouldn't be able to have a normal child's lifestyle,"" said Karina. ""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals. ""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care. ""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.

""On Sunday they took part in a minute's silence at Pollok Country Park for those who died during the pandemic.I remember: Scotland's Covid Memorial was created in the park in 2022 following a campaign by The Herald newspaper.The £250,000 tribute, which is made up of 40 tree supports, was designed by artist and poet Alec Finlay.The structures are designed to mimic a person supporting a tree, to demonstrate the support shown in communities during the global health crisis.Sunday's events include a candlelit vigil at the entrance to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow, organised by Scottish Covid Bereaved.Ms Devine said the sisters raised the alarm when they couldn't get their mother on the phone and called round to her house.She said: ""They said her temperature was fine and took her to the Royal Infirmary just to check her over. ""But just over an hour later, they were told the mother-of-three was in a critical condition. ""It was end of life, they couldn't save her,"" said Ms McCarron. ""That's how quick it was for everybody. ""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out. ""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants. ""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning. ""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body. ""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there. ""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point. ""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through. ""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us. ""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes. ""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own. ""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures. She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said. It added it had faced a choice on whether to re-invest in the Birmingham site, where the show is made, or finance new shows in the West Midlands.The final episode will be aired in December, with the corporation saying it would be ""working closely with BBC Studios to give it the finale it deserves"".Ms Ashby's petition said Doctors had ""brought laughter, tears, comedy and love into our homes and hearts"". Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends. ""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something. ""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said. ""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show. ""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"". ""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache. ""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free. ""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed. ""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award. ""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you. ""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music. ""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock! ""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle. ""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close. ""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano. ""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit. ""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing]. '""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began. ""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air. ""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it. ""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings. ""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song. ""'So what? ', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time. ""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary. ""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark. ""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said. ""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point. ""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss. ""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said. ""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be. ""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling. ""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.

""Les Flack, another member of the group, was worried about what the closure would mean for his wife, who has COPD: ""They're there all the time, the pulmonary team, so she goes there for assessments, blood tests, any specialist stuff. ""One of the people who stopped to ask questions and complete a survey was Caroline Cooper, who said: ""I have a 94-year-old mother who uses the phlebotomy department and I have grandchildren who will use these facilities in the future"".John Whittingdale, who is the local Conservative MP, believes keeping services local is more important than saving the building.He said: ""We've been talking about a new hospital for many years. ""I deeply regret it hasn't happened but maybe this is an opportunity to actually get that new provision in the town. ""The ICB said: ""The proposals set out a clear commitment to make sure services at St Peter's Hospital such as blood testing and a majority of out patient appointments, stay local. ""We encourage people to share their views. ""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X. Got a story?

""Ms Heslop, who was 41 when she vanished, is known to have left Mr Bane's boat moored off St John - which was under a 22:00 local time Covid curfew - to visit a bar and have dinner on 7 March.After three years without answers, Ms Street, of Ongar, Essex, says she feels ""let down"" by police on the Caribbean tourist hotspot and ""hatred"" for Mr Bane, whom she accuses of not doing enough to help find her daughter. ""I want to bring her home so I know where she is - she deserves that. ""The family now has an investigator, a former Metropolitan Police commander of homicide and serious crime, helping them look into the case.Ms Street, who has previously travelled to the island as part of the search for her daughter, told the paper: ""There's too many things that don't make sense and don't add up. ""She is calling on Mr Bane to provide the police with everything he knows about her daughter's disappearance.Under US law, Mr Bane - the last person known to have seen Miss Heslop and described as a ""person of interest"" by police - can stay silent and officers must show ""probable cause"" to get a search warrant.His lawyer, David Cattie, said in a statement to the newspaper that his client was ""heartbroken"" over Ms Heslop's disappearance. ""We certainly understand and empathise with her mother's pain and frustration. ""Mr Bane called 911 immediately upon waking and finding Sarm was not on board. ""He took his dinghy to shore to meet with Virgin Islands Police Department that night and called the US Coast Guard (USCG) the next day when no-one appeared at his boat. He also had the USCG on his vessel twice following Sarm's disappearance. ""Later Mr Bane and I personally took all of Sarm's belongings to the police, including all of her electronic devices.

All we've gone through and suddenly there was this massive void,"" said the former South Yorkshire miner. ""I didn't know what I was going do. ""Mr Keating, now 76, had spent a year on the frontline of one of the longest and most acrimonious industrial disputes in the country's history. He was among the first men to walk out on strike in March 1984 after learning of the government's plans to shut Cortonwood colliery, near Rotherham, and 19 other pits - some within weeks.More than 140,000 other miners across Britain soon joined them in downing tools. Many went unpaid for 12 months as the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), led by Arthur Scargill, fought to stop a colliery closure programme backed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.During that year, families struggled to afford food, clothe their children and heat their homes. They relied on community donations to survive, with miners' wives running soup kitchens, collecting money and food, and rallying support. ""There was a lot of heartache,"" said ex-miner Terry Cadwallander, whose brother took his own life while on strike. ""But we still had to keep going. ""For those involved, memories of the strike - and the pit closures which followed the union's defeat - remain raw 40 years on.In new interviews with the BBC, former miners, family members, police, journalists and politicians tell the story of the battle which changed Britain and its coalfield communities forever.Warning: contains strong languageIn March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) announced plans to shut 20 pits - which it said were unprofitable - with the loss of at least 20,000 jobs. Workers at Cortonwood colliery in Brampton Bierlow - earmarked to close within weeks - walked out on strike, followed by miners across Yorkshire and other parts of England, Scotland and Wales.As the strike stretched from weeks into months, mining families counted the cost of going unpaid.Miners' families relied on donations from their communities to survive. Wives ran soup kitchens, collected food and money, and held rallies to drum up support.The NUM sent protesters - known as flying pickets - to disrupt and pressure working miners. While most picket lines were relatively peaceful,violence flared between striking miners and police as tensions grew. Officers were drafted in from across the country in a coordinated national policing operation.In June 1984, thousands of miners from across Britain picketed at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in a bid to stop lorries delivering coal and collecting coke for Scunthorpe power plant. On 18 June, tensions reached boiling point. Police in riot gear on mounted horses charged at miners, leading to violent clashes. Ninety-five people were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder. All were later cleared.Arthur Scargill vetoed a national ballot on the strike, allowing regional NUM votes instead. In Nottinghamshire, parts of Derbyshire and North Wales, miners voted against joining the walkout and many carried on working. They were known as ""scabs"" by striking miners, who picketed as they arrived at work. Peter Short, a union official, was among those who worked.After a year on strike, a growing number of miners were choosing to return to work. On 3 March,1984, NUM leaders voted to end the dispute without an agreement with the NCB and instructed members to go back to work.By the end of 1985, 23 pits including Cortonwood had shut. Ninety-seven further closures followed before the coal industry was privatised in 1994. The UK's last deep coal mine shut in 2015.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze However, the chancellor told the BBC he could not give ""an absolute guarantee"" that the places needed would all be available in time. From April, the government has promised working parents of two-year-olds in England 15 hours of free care a week.Labour said the commitment was ""in tatters"", describing it as a ""botched pledge without a plan"". Under proposals announced in last year's Budget, the government is rolling out the expansion of free childcare in stages. Working parents of three and four-year-olds are already able to get 30 hours of free childcare. From September, it will be extended to 15 hours for those aged nine months and above. Then from September 2025, the government has pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for all under-fives. However, nurseries and other early years providers have warned they will struggle to meet the expected demand for the scheme. The sector argues that years of underfunding has led to a recruitment and retention crisis, meaning there are not enough staff to deliver the policy. Nurseries have also complained of delays in confirming how much they will be paid to offer free hours. Meanwhile, some parents have reported challenges finding local nurseries offering free hours which have places available. Asked if he could give a guarantee to parents and childcare providers that all the places needed to deliver the pledge would be ready for April, Mr Hunt said the policy amounted to ""the biggest expansion of childcare in a generation"". ""It may mean that we need to employ 40,000 more people in the sector and that's why we're bringing it in stages,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""You'll understand why I don't want to give an absolute guarantee. But am I confident we are delivering this programme and it will be on track for this April? Yes, I am. ""Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused Mr Hunt of ""rushing out"" the commitment ""with no plan to make it happen"". ""Now it's working parents, who in the weeks and months ahead - when they go and try and access those places that have been promised - will discover that they just can't be delivered in the way that he set out,"" she told the programme. She has written to the chancellor to demand the free childcare pledge will be delivered as scheduled and without parents facing extra charges. Asked what provision Labour would guarantee if it wins power, Ms Phillipson said: ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes the Conservatives have made - rushing something out without a plan to make it happen. ""She added her party had commissioned a review of early years by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir David Bell, which she said would look at how to drive up standards and ensure childcare places were available. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said the chancellor needed to address ""the huge challenges facing early years providers"", including by offering sustainable funding rates and removing business rates. ""This is the only way that nurseries can plan for a sustainable future and be able to deliver the increased childcare offer being made to parents,"" she said.Free childcare: Keegan confident of April startCash offer for new childcare workers amid shortageFamilies won't miss out on childcare - ministerWho gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply? Police Scotland said officers were called to the attraction in Glasgow's west end at about 11:55 on Sunday.Two women, aged 23 and 30, were charged following the incident, which involved a Queen Victoria bust.A spokesperson said the women were released on an undertaking to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court at a later date.Climate activist group, This is Rigged, said protesters staged a demonstration to raise awareness about rising food insecurity in the UK. Police said the accident happened on South Street, Whiteinch, at about 19:35 on Saturday. It involved a white Mercedes C43, a blue Vauxhall Corsa, a black Nissan Juke and several parked cars. A force spokesperson said the 26-year-old driver of the Mercedes, who has not been named, was pronounced dead at the scene. The 40-year-old female driver of the Nissan was taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital with serious injuries.

""This is the latest step in my running adventure, both to test my limits and to support a worthwhile charity,"" he said.Mr Dawson said he first took up running again after the Covid-19 lockdowns, ""in order to improve both my fitness and my mental health"". He has now completed more than 110 Parkruns and 10 formal 10km races, ""so a half marathon was logically the next challenge"", he added. ""I started daily 30 minute solo walks during lockdown, mainly to help my weight, I was gradually able to extend this to jogging, then running as the weight came off and my fitness improved. ""My first proper run with other people was the Wimpole Estate Parkrun in July 2021. ""Mr Dawson has joined Cambridge running group, 10K Tourists, which runs 10kms around Cambridge on Wednesday evenings, starting and finishing at various local pubs. ""My advice to anyone starting out on this journey is to go to parkruns if you can and also try to find a local group to run with once a week or so - it really helps. ""Dawn Preston, CamSight head of services, said: ""It is truly inspirational to hear John's challenge, taking on a half marathon at 73 is extremely impressive.

""I looked on the back of the packet at the ingredients and thought they weren't likely to improve your health in a significant way,"" she tells the BBC.Another company, Rheal Superfoods, which was featured on BBC programme Dragon's Den in 2021, claims its daily super greens blend supports digestive health, immune system and ""overall wellness from within"".Free Soul's FS Greens blend also makes similar claims, promising to offer digestion and immunity support through key ingredients such as ashwagandha, golden kiwi and maca.A spokesperson for Athletic Greens told the BBC: ""Our team of scientists and researchers have reviewed thousands of studies as part of the formulation and continuous improvement process for AG1."" The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"".Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing.These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety.Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality. ""She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable."" Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"".She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"".Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"".One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030. ""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC. ""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds.Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose. ""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says. ""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds.Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health.Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"".There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"". ""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds.Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit. ""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds.She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables.Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"". ""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds.She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist.Plant-based diets good for the heartBigger breakfasts better for controlling appetiteVegetables alone not enough to reduce heart riskLiquid diets: Do they work and are they safe? RNLI heritage manager David Weldon said he was ""blown away"" by the display, organised to coincide with the charity's 200th anniversary.Sir William Hillary was living in Douglas and witnessed numerous shipwrecks around the coast when he petitioned for the institution.Sir William founded the RNLI in 1824.All At Sea, at the House of Manannan in Peel, was officially opened by the island's lieutenant governor ahead of the anniversary on 4 March.The project, which was a collaboration between the charity and Manx National Heritage (MHH), features some ""very special"" objects, including the gold medal given to Sir William by the institution for founding it.MNH curator Allison Fox said that was a significant feature because ""we know that it was around the coast of the Isle of Man that the idea was formed"".She added: ""He writes in Douglas in February 1823 that the idea of this national institution 'has only suggested itself to me since my residence on a part of the coast often exposed to the most distressing scenes of misery'. ""To have this illustration of that point in history, when this fantastic thing started, is great to have. ""The medal has been loaned to MNH by the RNLI, but the exhibition also contains items relating to the formation from the Manx National Collections.They include original pamphlets outlining what it should be founded on, including the earliest in which Sir William sets out why an organisation was needed, and what it should be. ""This particular one is a first edition and it's just got 'from the author' written on it, which is a nice touch,"" Ms Fox said.Reflecting on the mixture of the island's role as the birthplace of the lifesaving institution and broader Manx maritime heritage, Mr Weldon said the balance of ""tales of endeavour and shipwreck"" together with its place in the RNLI's history was ""just right"".Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

""It can even be used on fingerprints that are a week old. ""Two different coloured dyes, called LFP-Yellow and LFP-Red, bind selectively with the negatively-charged molecules found in fingerprints, locking the dye molecules in place and emitting a fluorescent glow that can be seen under blue light. ""Having two different colours available means the spray can be used on different coloured surfaces. ""We're hoping to produce more colours in the future. ""The dyes are based on a fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is used extensively by research scientists to visualise biological processes. This means the dyes are biologically compatible and don't interfere with subsequent DNA analysis of the fingerprints.The fine spray prevents splashes that could damage prints, is less messy than a powder and works quickly even on rough surfaces where it is harder to capture fingerprints, such as brick.Dr Luling Wu, also from the University of Bath (UK), said: ""The probes are only weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but emit strong fluorescence once they bind to the fingerprints through the interaction between the probes and fatty acids or amino acids. ""The team is working in collaboration with scientists from Shanghai Normal University, China. Principal investigator, Professor Chusen Huang, said: ""We hope this technology can really improve the detection of evidence at crime scenes. ""We are now collaborating with some companies to make our dyes available for sale. Further work is still ongoing.

Her daughter is a pupil at Ballycraigy Primary and she said she had been relieved by the warm welcome. “Coming to this country was not easy for us,"" she explained. ""We don’t know anyone here and we don’t have any family or anything. ""So for Ballycraigy Primary School to have an inclusion week and for them to make us feel like we are part of the family that is very, very important. And I do not take that for granted.”Nosipho said she had never encountered any issues around her race in Ballycraigy. ""Everyone is embracing us. I am happy here now,"" she said.Nosipho Muzvidziwa moved to Northern Ireland from South Africa  Among the delicacies on offer at the food tasting were Chinese soups, Indian daal and fruits from South America. One of the pupils, Kwabena, also known as KO, brought in some noodles which are popular in Ghanian culture.“My friends absolutely loved the noodles; they’d never tried them before but they were a bit spicy,"" he said.His friend Addison said she had yet to try them, but added ""I think that they are amazing”. Jordan Bone, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was just 15 when she became a quadriplegic in the accident.After battling depression, her beauty videos attracted millions of views on YouTube, but singing had always been her passion. ""It feels incredible to have a song out there in the world,"" she said.Ms Bone was a passenger in a car that rolled into a ditch in 2005. ""When I became conscious I was lying against the roof with the seatbelt wrapped around my neck,"" she said. ""I thought I was going to die. I remember thinking, 'I am 15 years old, I've got so much to do'. ""I began singing Candi Staton's You've Got the Love - and it was probably just a whisper - but it brought me back to the moment. It felt like singing saved me. ""Ms Bone said she realised in that moment that she was paralysed, but she assumed that after spinal surgery life would be ""exactly the same, but in a wheelchair"". ""I didn't realise all the support I would need,"" she said. ""At that time I was starting to get more independence; to have that taken away felt like starting from scratch. ""After a couple of years it really hit me, I became down and I felt quite isolated and excluded - especially as a teenager, as if being a teenager isn't hard enough. ""In time, guided meditations helped her, and she began to post her own positivity videos about beauty and living with a disability. ""You didn't see many people with disability in the beauty world, and I wanted to be one of those people to help make those changes,"" she said.Ms Bone has always loved singing and songwriting, and she has now teamed up with musician Jim Kakes to release ""dream pop"" tune Solid Ground. ""The song is about love, trust and the twists and turns that come with it, the desire and insecurities from past situations and expecting something unhealthy when, surprisingly, it is grounded and safe,"" she said. ""You start from you own ideas and you are making something that everyone can now listen to, so that part of the process feels quite magical, and it feels so special to me. ""I want to keep the momentum going; I am really proud of it and I want to become a stronger songwriter. ""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. Got a story?

""The farmers were protesting over the foreign imports of food which the said was damaging British farmingSome bystanders applauded the convoy as it passed through the city.One said: ""I'm here to back British food and British farming, and to ensure that the government know all the supermarkets that are selling imports from Spain should be fighting to support these guys who are having a pretty rough time. ""In a statement, the Defra said: “We firmly back our farmers. ""British farming is at the heart of British trade and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.“We’ve maintained the £2.4 billion annual farming budget which supports farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably and are also looking at ways to further improve fairness in the supply chain and support British farmers and growers, as well as ensuring customers have access to high-quality fresh British products.”The Canterbury protest follows a tractor go-slow demonstration at the port of DoverAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at British Retail Consortium, said: “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers. ""Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce.

""I've been trying to get this job for eight years, constantly grinding, constantly asking to do little slots,"" he said. ""No-one is given a job here because their mum or dad helped them into it. You have to earn your colours."" Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club. ""North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication. ""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said. ""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them. ""Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online.

Police Scotland said he was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement, released by the force on Sunday, Thomas' family said they were ""utterly heartbroken"".It continued: ""Thomas was the perfect son. He was the best little brother to his older sister and was adored by all his family. ""Thomas went to Cramond Primary School which he loved. He made good friends there. We will all miss him terribly. ""The family, who live in Edinburgh, added they were very grateful for all the sympathy and heartfelt messages they had received.On Friday, Helen Donaldson, head teacher of Cramond Primary School, said Thomas was ""always smiling"" and that he was a ""positive, friendly and curious"" boy.She said: ""We are utterly devastated by the tragic news of the sudden death of one our pupils. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this incredibly difficult time. ""He was kind and always eager to support others, and will be greatly missed by all of us. ""Insp Andrew Thomson said: ""Our thoughts are very much with Thomas's family and friends. Specially trained officers are supporting the family at this time. ""We are continuing with our inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would appeal to anyone who may have information, and has not yet contacted police, is to get in touch with officers."" Insp Thomson also urged anyone with private CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.The bin lorry driver was not injured in the incident, which happened near the junction with Braehead Road.Thomas is the second child to be killed after being hit by a bin lorry in Scotland this year.Last month an 11-year-old girl died in hospital in Edinburgh a week after she was critically injured in the Borders.Elizabeth Bell was struck by a vehicle on the A6105, near East Gordon, on 31 January.Boy, aged 11, dies after being hit by bin lorryContact Police Scotland One video, which has had millions of views, shows the mysterious figure appearing from behind a mirror to whimpering children.But now The Unknown has been unmasked as 16-year-old Felicia, from Glasgow.And she is thrilled her first paid acting job has gone viral.The villain was met with confusion worldwide as The Unknown was noticeably absent from the plot of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Felicia told BBC Scotland News: ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""In the lead up to last month's event the organisers, House of Illuminati, advertised a ""journey filled with wondrous creations"".Willy Wonka was a fictional chocolatier who ran a competition for lucky finders of a golden ticket to visit his factory.But visitors who hoped to relive the classic book and movies - including the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder - were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at a sparsely-decorated warehouse.The event was held last weekend in an industrial estate in Whiteinch, where actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a small bouncy castle.Children were offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans on their trip to the imaginary sweet factory.Parents paid up to £35 a ticket but were so appalled they called Police Scotland. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.According to the script, which is said to be the result of artificial intelligence, The Unknown was an evil rival chocolate maker who lives in walls.The story involves his attempt to steal Willy's ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"".Felicia was originally cast in the starring role of Willy McDuff - seemingly inspired by Willy Wonka - before opting for The Unknown.A video of the villain, dressed in a silver mask and black cloak, emerging from behind a mirror to unhappy children took off on social media last week.The teenager said: ""There weren't any rehearsals. I got there early to practise but it hadn't been set up. ""The actors came up later and it still hadn't been set up. ""We were all saying it was a mess and there hadn't been any organisation, but we were just hoping that together it wouldn't be that bad. But it was. ""The actors were told to improvise on the day, so Felicia waited behind the mirror for each of the three Willy McDuff characters to pass through with their group.She said: ""My character didn't make any sense without the Wonka explaining who I was, that I was The Unknown, an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls. ""So I was just sitting behind the mirror trying to act creepy because that was the only direction I was given. ""It was definitely a mixed bag of reactions. Some people loved it, some people were terrified of it. ""But I think most people didn't really know what I was there for - which was the same for me. ""Felicia said her concerns about the performance intensified just 45 minutes after the doors opened.She recalled: ""The first few runs were actually working quite well because there was order in it. ""But people were straggling in and then it was just all going wrong. ""In the room next to the mirror, one of the Wonkas had been in there for like an hour straight and he hadn't left and the other two Wonkas had just disappeared. ""During that time more people were coming along and it would build up and build up. ""I was sitting behind the mirror texting my mum saying it was going so wrong. ""Felicia said each Wonka led a group of about 60 people and often they could not all fit in one room.She added: ""One of the other Wonkas made up a storyline that if the children pulled a silly face at me, I would be scared and hide back in my corner. ""That worked really well and it would kind of make sense with the plot. ""But that didn't happen every time so sometimes I just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner. ""Felicia revealed she still has the costume from the event and said it was ""quite funny"" that people had been asking for it.After the experience was shut down, the actors went to the pub for a debrief.She recalled: ""When we came back it was just a big massive mob outside. ""There were like four police cars outside. It was really crazy. ""But despite the backlash, Felicia said the response had been positive on the whole.She added: ""At first I was really embarrassed about it. But when we went to the pub after, we were just laughing about it. ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""And now it's become viral, it's genuinely life-changing and I'm really happy I did it. ""Everybody loves the character and posting about it, so it makes me happy that people can see the funny side."" Doctor's had described Elijah, from Pontypridd, as a medical ""mystery"" and were unable to explain his constant illness prior his diagnosis.Chloe Jones, Elijah's mum and also a nurse, said he has ""never gone longer than two weeks"" without becoming ill.Elijah is now in need of a bone marrow transplant and his family are urging people to help them find a match.Chloe said she first began to piece together why Elijah had been in and out of hospital for almost 18 months, while giving him a bath. ""I noticed there were quite a few bruises going along his spine… then I noticed his mouth and his tongue and lips had all of these blood spots and they looked like blisters,"" she said. She and her partner Rhys began to consider that low levels of blood platelets - cells which help prevent bleeding - could be affecting Elijah's health.After a 10-day stay in the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, Elijah was diagnosed with genetic condition Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood cancer which affects young children.In just 12 weeks, Elijah had developed tonsillitis, croup, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, and an ear infection. ""If he just had a common cold it would lead to something else, it would be sickness, he would be off his food... and then it would be something else - it was just constant,"" said Chloe.Chemotherapy is not as effective for treating Elijah's condition, as JMML is not an active cancer, lying  dormant until patients become unwell.Elijah requires a bone marrow transplant, where healthy stem cells are implanted into the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy cells.His family are now appealing for people to sign up to the stem cell register, in order to give Elijah the best chance of finding a donor match.Elijah's appeal has received the support of blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as well as a number of celebrities and sports stars. A social media post from Chloe to update friends and family about her son's progress was shared by far and wide, including by former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp.Chloe said she and Rhys had been trying to keep Elijah's life as normal as possible, by doing a lot of outdoor activities such as walks and trips to the park, but his life has become limited. ""We've taken him out of childcare, to just try and eliminate any risk of him getting any kind of illness at childcare, soft plays, anywhere like that is a 'no go' zone,"" she said. Speaking ahead of his second birthday celebrations, Chloe said it had been ""really hard"" to make any plans. ""I can't guarantee what the weather is going to be like, I can't plan anything, so no plans yet. Hopefully we can just go for a walk or to the park. As much as I love Wales it is quite tough. ""Despite his health troubles, Chloe says Elijah hasn't let his condition slow him down, and that ""you wouldn't think anything was wrong if you saw him"". ""Even when he was really unwell and he was in hospital he was still running up and down the corridors, going into the other children's rooms, pinching chocolates and snacks... he is definitely a little soldier."" Chloe said it had been helpful to finally have some answers for Elijah's health problems, and to have the support of parents of other children her son had been in hospital with. In an appeal for people to add their name to the stem cell register, she said: ""You don't know how much it's needed until you see it first hand and it's such a simple thing to do to donate your bone marrow. ""It's absolutely life changing for those who need it and there are so many people who do need it, and there's not enough people on the register. ""It's so simple to get on the register, if you're already donating blood or platelets, it's just a tick box, and if you're not, it's just a mouth swab. It's so simple, and if you get called up you're potentially saving a life.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze Here, Nadiya reflects on how her childhood shaped her - ending with the words she composed for her 13-year-old. From the moment she was born, I realised I was not prepared to bring a daughter into this world who would ever think that she was less than anyone else.She is my youngest child. I have two sons as well - they are 16 and 17.I knew growing up as brown Muslim boys would be hard for them both - but they have not had to deal with the hurdles and challenges facing my daughter. There is an affirmation that I've taught them all - but especially her: ""Elbows out."" You need to make space for yourself wherever you go.Now she is a teenager, I don't want my daughter to lose the big dreams and bold ambitions that I lost as a girl.At school, in Luton in the early 1990s, I remember learning about world leaders in history. ""That's what I want to be,"" I thought. ""I'm going to become prime minister."" But then somebody would say: ""Well, have you ever seen a brown prime minister?"" And that particular dream would be squashed.It makes you think how far we have come today.As I approached the age my daughter is now, Nadiya the dreamer was disappearing. I could see that the path ahead of me was to be different to that of my brothers. There was a hierarchy in my family - and men were always at the top. My brothers had freedom, they could socialise, and they could get an education. Although I worked hard in my A-levels and wanted to go to university, my mum told me there was absolutely no way. ""You're a girl, you need to get married,"" she said. I felt as though the person who once had been so lively was disappearing. But now, when I look back, I am proud of who I have become. I think my children are too.Dear Daughter: Elbows out with Nadiya HussainListen on BBC SoundsWhen I was a little girl, I never saw anyone like me on a TV cookery show. OK, I might not be prime minister, but thanks to my passion for baking, I have become a British Bangladeshi in the public eye. Baking built my confidence and helped me cope with my anxiety - I have PTSD and panic disorder. It helped me make connections with people, through the sharing of food.Maybe the big dreams of Nadiya, the little girl, weren't so unrealistic after all.Both my daughter and eldest son love baking. My second son does the dishes. My husband on the other hand is a terrible cook. Once, as he was boiling eggs, they exploded and hit the ceiling.My daughter is very smart, conscientious and kind. She rolls her eyes sometimes when I give her advice - but I know she is really listening deep down.When I sent this letter to my daughter on her phone, she asked if we could frame it and put it in her room. ""Absolutely, we'll frame it,"" I said. I never want to lose our lines of communication.This is your Ma, though when I speak, I know you do not listen. Not really. You shrug. You dismiss, you reel in disgust, as I suggest that I may know better. You look at me and all you see is your mother. The Woman, the person you have known your whole life.You see what is stood in front of you, though often bedraggled. I am here. I am your mother. That is all you see. Not the person that came before her. Let me tell you a little bit about that little girl.That girl, well, she was nothing like your mother. This girl, she was wild. She had great thoughts and even greater dreams. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She spoke about how she felt. She spoke about change. She preached about fairness. Even at her tender age. She knew where she wanted to be. Despite the blockades that life had in store for her.Sometimes I daydream and wonder where that little girl went. How did she disappear out of plain sight so fast? Then I look at you and realise you are that little girl. Same, but entirely different. Fierce, bold and bright, like your mother before you.This is your Ma. Though even when I speak, I know you do not listen. Just know that the little girl inside me that I once was, and I once lost, is holding your hand. And we won't lose another little girl ever again. Let your fire always be fierce. May your purpose guide you. Be the brightest shining light.Baking the Queen's birthday cake More than 4,500 people work at Asos's distribution centre in Grimethorpe - more than that who live in the former south Wales mining village of Maerdy.How well they've responded to losing their mine, the old village heartbeat, depends on your barometer of success.Is getting bigger better, or is it all about a tight-knit community spirit?A quarter of the Welsh population live in former coalfield communities and near the head of the Rhondda Valley in Maerdy, there's a few shops, takeaways, a pub and one road in and one road out. On a busy day, it can take almost two-and-a-half hours on public transport to get the nearest big city, so locals say people have to move away from their community to get work.Roads, railway lines and more importantly industry - or jobs  - never arrived after the pit shut in 1990, five years after miners went back to work following the miners' strike. ""Lots of things were promised, but not a lot of things came to the valley,"" said Dawn Wood, who was deputy head at Maerdy Primary for 45 years, including during the strike. ""That is a condemnation of any government, whether it's Labour, Conservative, every government. I cannot blame one more than the other. ""Coal has been at the heart of everything in Maerdy for more than 100 years - livelihoods, the social and sporting scene. The mine was the community.When miners marched back to work at the local mine in 1985 after the strike, it was the beginning of the end for coal mining in the village.The town walked in lockstep with the miners, accompanied by a brass band, but within five years the pit was gone for good - and Dawn, now in her 60s, reckons the village's fortunes have steadily declined. ""It is the lack of foresight, they promise things but they don't put it in,"" said Dawn. ""So as far as I'm concerned it is not the people that have let the valleys down, it is governments that have let the valleys down. ""Dawn isn't alone as a new BBC survey suggests three in five people said closing the pits had a negative impact on their area - and almost three-quarters polled said they'd seen little or no regeneration. ""Shops have closed, everybody had to go out of the valley to work... It's all gone, it's not the same,"" said lifelong Maerdy resident Phil Pugh.There is also more deprivation, higher unemployment and poorer health, and new research estimates nearly 20% of people are out of work in the village deep in the Rhondda Fach Valley. ""We haven't got a train, they promised a new road that was supposed to come all the way up to Maerdy, but it only came up as far as Pontygwaith,"" said Gill Owen and Trina Coombs, who join the Knit and Natter group in Maerdy every Tuesday. ""You've got one road in and one road out. Big businesses will not come up here, because of the cost of their travelling time. If there's an accident, you can't get out. ""Last year the workmens' club in Tylorstown got burnt down. We were stuck for four days. ""While the last four decades haven't been kind to Maerdy, some former coalfield communities have flourished.Miners in the Yorkshire village Grimethorpe in south Yorkshire marched back to work around the same time as those in Maerdy, also accompanied by their own brass band made famous by the Ewan McGregor film Brassed Off.Grimethorpe's pit shut in 1993 - and within a year the village near Barnsley was considered the poorest in the UK with half the workforce unemployed. ""Let's be blunt, the government walked away - it devastated that community and said goodbye... and in a sense everything just imploded,"" said Sir Stephen Houghton, head of the multi-agency Grimethorpe Regeneration Board.This video can not be playedThe story of the miners' strikes in Wales in 1984 and 1985""This wasn't miners losing a few jobs, they lost a whole way of life. Everything disappeared overnight. Society in the village started to break down. Crime and disorder went through the roof. ""But a £100m injection built new roads, attracted industry including international fashion retailer Asos, and Grimethorpe - about halfway between Leeds and Sheffield - has grown. ""We had to show the people of Grimethorpe, that somebody cared about them and would work with them, and try and find funds, to try and turn the thing around,"" added Sir Stephen, now Barnsley council leader.Grimethorpe grew - the fortunes of the village and those who lived there changed - but not everyone benefited. ""The new road opened up a lot of possibilities,"" said internationally-renowned dance artist Gary Clarke, who is was born and bred in Grimethorpe. ""It's also brought a lot of new people into the village. I don't want to paint a picture like it's all a bed of roses. It's definitely not. The scars still run very deep in Grimethorpe. ""You can see the division between the old community and some of the newer people that come into the village. What brings people together in Grimethorpe is the legacy of the place. ""A lot of the newer people don't necessarily know the history that Grimethorpe is built on and so with that I think they don't have that community spirit. The soul of Grimethorpe's changed dramatically, but we are trying our best to bring those two sides together. ""It's the opposite back in Maerdy. While some may think they have nothing, others feel having each other is everything - a community spirit that many villages yearn for. ""Open your door, and there's always somebody who'd do you a favour"", says Karen Knott, enjoying a weekly catch-up at Knit and Natter. ""If you were ill, they'd post you a letter, get you a pint of milk - they'd still do it now. My husband was putting an old bike in the car the other day, and somebody came along and asked if he needed any help. ""The current head at the local school likens the current cost of living crisis to the strike in the 80s - and she feels it was community that got people through then, and it will be community that will get people through now. ""During the strike people stood together and helped each other,"" said Maerdy primary head Helen Gregory. ""Today with the financial climate that we're in, people need help as they did back then and we still have people standing side by side helping each other. ""If you go out and about in Maerdy people know each other, people care about each other. There are not many jobs in Maerdy - but we're proud to live here. ""Welsh miners in Ukraine to repay 1984 strike helpHow did the miners' strike affect Wales?Voices from the 1984 miners' strike They have been organised by the Memory Stones of Love group, which was set up by families wanting to remember their loved ones together.Events are taking place across the UK on Sunday to remember lives lost as part of a national day of reflection.In Londonderry bereaved families took part in a walk across the Peace Bridge.A minute's silence was then held in the city's Peace Flame Garden.Ciaran Ward's parents Bredge and Owen Ward, from Strabane, County Tyrone, died within 12 hours of each other in November 2020. ""Today is a special day for all of the bereaved families to come together to grieve together to remember their loved ones,"" Mr Ward told BBC News NI. ""For myself, during the pandemic to lose Mum and Dad, it feels surreal, it still doesn't feel real. ""Mr Ward recalled being unable to visit his parents in hospital due to the strict measures put in place at the time to reduce transmission of the Covid-19 virus. ""Not being able to see them - everyone in life wants to be with their family as they pass away,"" he said. ""And they also want to be at home. And for us, for Mum and Dad - they were denied that. ""He added: ""It's important that as a collective society that we all come together and we remember the horror that has happened and the trauma that has happened for so many people. ""Catriona Myles's father Gerry McLarnon was 67 when he died during the pandemic. She recalled how her dad, who suffered from cancer, died without family members present when he was admitted to hospital in December 2020 after contracting Covid.The annual day of reflection is ""so important for the families"", she said.She said she was at Sunday's event ""to bring comfort, compassion and solidarity to other families that have faced the same losses as ourselves"". ""Everyone wants to move on and I understand that as a society we need to move on but, for the families, there are so many questions unanswered,"" she added. ""And it's a very lonely place that we're in a lot of the time. ""Families also attended events in Belfast and Enniskillen to remember those who died. In Belfast Memory Stones of Love organised a the craft event, from which bereaved family members planned to walk together to Belfast City Hall, which will be lit up yellow in memory of those who died.Last year the group laid more than 300 memory stones in the shape of a heart outside City Hall.The stones were individually painted and bore the name of a loved one who died in the pandemic.Other public buildings across Northern Ireland, including the Guildhall in Derry, will also be illuminated yellow on Sunday evening as a mark of respect. Covid bereaved gather to remember lost loved onesCouple dies 12 hours apart with Covid-19Politicians lack humanity, Covid daughter says ""It was mental,"" said Meg and Charlie, both 29, who live in Swansea. James gifted the couple the tickets for the show, which took place at London's O2 Arena, as an engagement present.The DJ also spent the night itself at the couple's home in Swansea, babysitting their daughter, Maisie, seven - where he got his nails painted. ""Maisie absolutely loved it,"" said Meg, who's originally from Pontypridd, joking that James had a ""similar mindset of age"" to their daughter. James appeared to enjoy himself as well, posting a picture of him playing with Maisie's doll house, as well as a video of them together at the park. He also posted a list of chores Maisie had given him, which included washing the dishes with pink gloves, reading time, and salon time.A photo posted later in the night showed James with a set of pink nails. The relationship between the couple and the DJ started when Charlie appeared on a segment of James' show called What's my Age Again, and ""stupidly"" got his own age wrong. It developed from there, with both Charlie and Meg appearing on the show, both individually and together, in the last few months. They appeared again on Friday and were expecting to take part in a ""Mr and Mrs"" style quiz, which Meg said she had researched for. ""But it was a complete ploy - they told us the truth, that they wanted us to swap lives,"" she said. James said he had attended the show before, and wanted to give away his and his wife's tickets. He offered to babysit the couple's daughter, and on Saturday Meg and Charlie travelled to London where they were put up in a hotel. ""The only thing we had to worry about what was finding something to wear,"" Meg said.They said they had an ""amazing time"" at the show, with seats close to the stage, and indulged in a fair amount of celeb-spotting. They were also full of praise for James, describing him as a ""selfless"" and ""genuine person"". Meg is a maternity worker for the NHS, and Charlie a field technician for an advertising company, and the couple joked they had a ""very romantic story"" of meeting online. Meg is originally from Pontypridd and Charlie from Essex, and James has described the couple as ""a real life Gavin and Stacey"". ""To be honest, we're more like Nessa and Smithy,"" said Meg, referring to the characters played by James Corden and Ruth Jones. ""We like KFC too much."" It was a night out the television characters would likely have embraced. ""We were back by 2am. We ended the night with a McDonald's - that's our kind of night,"" Meg said.

Researchers at the University of Surrey taught an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict the 3D pose from a 2D image of a dog.A myriad of virtual dogs were created using the video game Grand Theft Auto.Postgraduate research student Moira Shooter said: ""From ecology to animation, this neat solution has so many possible uses. ""One way to teach AI to get 3D information from 2D images is to show it photos while giving it information about 3D 'ground truth' - where the objects are in 3D space.For humans, that means wearing motion capture suits. Unable to replicate the same with dogs, researchers altered the code of Grand Theft Auto V, switching the main character for one of eight breeds of dog - a process known as modding.They generated 118 videos of the dogs sitting, walking, barking and running in a range of different weather and lighting conditions. The team called their new database DigiDogs, which was made up of 27,900 frames.They now plan to fine tune the system using Meta's DINOv2 model to make sure it can predict a 3D pose just as well from real dog pictures. ""Our model was trained on CGI dogs, but we were able to use it to make 3D skeletal models from photographs of real animals,"" Ms Shooter said. ""That could let conservationists spot injured wildlife, or help artists create more realistic animals in the metaverse. She added: ""3D poses contain so much more information than 2D photographs.

The HeraldThe ScotsmanDaily RecordThe Scottish SunDaily MailScottish Daily ExpressThe TimesThe TelegraphThe NationalThe CourierThe P&JGlasgow TimesEdinburgh News Wiltshire's chalk streams host a huge amount of wildlife and despite looking clear, they have been failing to meet ""good"" ecological health status. The Wylye Chalk Stream Project involves farmers, the Wessex Rivers Trust (WRT) and the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust (WWT).Alice Eley, WWT's water team manager, said: ""They [chalk streams] support very unique biodiversity. ""The project, which Ms Eley said is of an ""unprecedented"" scale, has been funded by the government's Landscape Recovery scheme.Some of the wildlife supported by chalk streams and rivers in Wiltshire, such as in the Wylye Valley and Salisbury Plain, include salmon, brown trout, otters and water voles. Chalk streams come straight from the aquifer, a type of rock or sediment which holds groundwater, with the water filtered through the chalk, giving it unique features like a neutral temperature all year round.Ms Eley said the conditions helped certain plants to thrive, such as water crowfoot (Ranunculus), ""which is what these rivers are designated for,"" she added. ""They [chalk streams] react very strongly to pollution. A small water quality change can have a devastating impact on chalk streams,"" Ms Eley said.Josh Stratton is one of the group of farmers in the area involved in the project - they want to return the river to it's natural course and closer to the environment that it would have enjoyed a century or two ago.On one stretch, he has put in gravel to make it shallow in parts, but also made deeper areas, as well as sections that are fast or slow-flowing.Changes like this provide a larger variety of habitats for wildlife, including improving conditions for fish spawning. ""This land is almost post-agricultural so my tonnes per hectare of water voles will be increasing not my tonnes per hectare of wheat,"" explained Mr Stratton.He said he is excited about the project and pleased that the government has put in a framework, but said the science helps too: ""Having real scientists to make it work for farmers has helped. You can't expect farmers to do that in isolation. ""The Wylye Chalk Stream Project is one of 34 successful schemes to come from the Landscape Recovery fund.Ms Eley said: ""Farmers are almost the lifeblood of the river - all of our rivers go through farmland. ""We want farmers to give rivers space - to grow, move, flood out, to do all the things a natural river should do.

It would be the biggest ever rollout of new bathing water sites as part of the Government's plan to improve water quality across the country. ""This is a massive win for ordinary Taunton residents and users of our River Tone,"" said Mr Amos.

There have also been a spate of failures, including broken rails and signalling faults.The route is now set to be overhauled in three phases over 18 months.Thousands of runners have taken to the streets for an annual half marathon in Berkshire.About 3,500 competitors, including elite runners, began running the Wokingham Half Marathon at 10:00 GMT.Starting and finishing at Cantley Park, the race takes participants through the town centre, although a contingency route has been put in place this year due to flooding.Organisers said the event raises more than £100,000 for charity each year.Antlers on a life-size stag sculpture were sawn off in a spate of ""wanton vandalism"", a resident has said.Clean cut marks can be seen towards the base of each antler on the monument in Savernake Park, Bracknell, suggesting they were deliberately removed.Ken Toogood, one of those to spot the damage, said those responsible must have been ""clandestine"" and it looked ""premeditated"" given the use of tools.Were it not for a nearby sign, passers-by would have no clue what once stood on a grassy spot in Berkshire.Beside an arrow pointing to a campus gym, another points to the Imperial College Reactor Centre in Ascot.While the sports building is clearly visible, all that stands in front of it now is an open field.But for almost half a century, the patch of grass - not far from Ascot's world-famous racecourse and Legoland - was home to a nuclear reactor.Now, after 10 years' work, it has become the first civil nuclear site in Britain to be fully decommissioned - the point where regulators have been able to revoke its licence and end the strict controls imposed to protect the public.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Harri Barker has helped to bring saunas to the GowerThey are more commonly spotted in the corners of gyms and luxury hotels - but saunas are starting to pop up on the Welsh coast.Swansea's Gower peninsula in winter may seem like a strange place to relax in your swimsuit, but more and more people are visiting, keen to chase away the rainy day blues.It is the Scandinavian model being followed - where people can move from the cold of the sea, quickly to the warm. The British Sauna society (BSS) was set up almost 10 years ago with a focus on bringing the authentic sauna to the UK, and said numbers have doubled, with an increasing amount outside.It believes these could potentially replace pubs and community centres which are closing - but what is the appeal?‘’It is time away from your phone, time away from the rush of everyday life,"" Harri Barker told BBC Wales Live. ""It kind of brings you back to earth a little bit.’’ She set up Ty Sawna on the Gower in 2022, with one of they reasons being its connection to nature. ‘’That is what it's all about,’’ she added.‘’It can be sunny, raining, snowing or stormy, but you just sit in the sauna and it's like a portal that takes you somewhere else.’""It’s an activity which encourages others to get outside during the winter season. ‘’When a lot of people find it really difficult to cope over the colder months, it’s a way to get people out and meeting new people.’’Scotland’s new wild sauna culture. Video, 00:01:53Scotland’s new wild sauna cultureBoxing Day swimmers fear sewage in seaWith two saunas at Oxwich Bay, Harri is on the sands at 06:00 most mornings during the winter, stoking the fire and setting up.Regular visitors include a group of cold water swimmers, and she said the combination of the hot and cold immersion keeps people coming back. ‘’There is no feeling quite like it,"" Harri said.‘’It's just this buzz that you get, this natural high.’’It may be cold outside, but it is relaxing inside with a sea viewSecretary of the BSS Gabrielle Reason said there is a real difference between these saunas and the ones commonly seen in the UK. ‘’The normal ones tend to be in the corner of a gym or in a hotel,"" she said.‘’People will sit in there, they'll get hot, uncomfortable and think 'that's enough'.‘’A lot of time if you go into a badly built sauna you don’t even access the benefits.’’She explained that the Finnish and Scandinavian style involves a more cyclical approach to the activity - moving from hot to cold and repeating this for up to an hour and a half.Gabrielle said that some research suggests this traditional sauna experience could be good for our physical health. ‘’We are doing some of the same things for our body that exercise would do,"" she added.Gabrielle added some people have suggested it is like going into a therapy room, adding: ‘’When you look at what has been happening in the UK - the closing of pubs and community centres - I think it has potential to actually start replacing those things.’’Could saunas appear in more locations around the coast?‘’I would say the biggest benefit is a reduction in blood pressure,"" said Dr Tom Cullen, an assistant professor in Applied Physiology at Coventry University.‘’It’s particularly important in a Western society, where we're typically highly stressed and often have a poor diet.‘’You also see large improvements to vascular function as well.’’He has been studying the impact of heat therapy and the health benefits it can have, but stressed it cannot replace exercise.‘’If you compare things like weight loss, which is a real goal of lots of people that exercise, for example, you're not likely to see much benefit,"" Dr Cullen added.Ryan Stephens says you can meet people from all walks of lifeRyan Stephens is the founder of sea dipping group, the Wet Bandits, who are one of the regular visitors to Ty Sawna. ‘’The conversations you end up having in the sauna tend to be really deep, meaningful and are usually focused on health and wellbeing,’’ he said.‘’You meet people from all different walks of life. ''It breaks down barriers and allows people to connect at a really genuine level. ''It has become a favourite hobby of Oliver Bailey’It's so different compared to going to the pub or even going for a walk in the park,"" said cold dipper Oliver Bailey.‘’It really stands out. It's just wild.’’While Ty Sawna and many other outdoor saunas are currently on the coast, the BSS sees no reason why they cannot spread to other locations.‘’We want people to see this as a health activity like going to the gym or going to a yoga lesson,’’ secretary Gabrielle said.‘’I think a lot of the saunas cropping up have attracted white, middle class people but there's definitely people who are looking to push that.’‘’There are projects looking at getting social prescribers to start recommending it as a preventative health measure.’’https://www.britishsaunasociety.org.uk/https://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/ Pen-y-Bont in Abergele, Conwy, was relaunched on St David's Day after refurbishment, with what some called a ""slapdash translation"" of its name. The Bridge Head is now displayed prominently on signs, with its Welsh-language name appearing in smaller writing below.The BBC has contacted the owners to respond. ""It disparages the Welsh language... this is some kind of slapdash translation, which is unacceptable,"" said local Dylan Rhys Jones. ""You have the English translation in big letters and the Welsh name in small letters underneath. ""I don't see the reason why they need to change the name. ""Gareth Bolton, who also lives nearby, said the decision to ""rebrand the pub"" had attracted a lot of attention from local residents on social media.He said he was in favour of empty buildings being brought back to life but not ""mindlessly changing names from Welsh to English"".He pointed to another example - Y Gwindy being changed to The Winery, adding: ""At the end of the 19th century, Abergele had 16 pubs, all of them with an English name apart from Pen-Y-Bont and the Gwindy. ""The names of these institutions are woven into local culture, identity and history. ""The savage act of erasing our language is atrocious. ""Language use has divided opinion, with some saying that where names are similar - such as Treorci/Treorchy or Caerffili/Caerphilly - the Welsh version only could be used.Some national parks have also moved to use Welsh names only, such as Eryri and Bannau Brycheiniog - formerly known as Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons respectively.In Eryri, Llyn Tegid has sometimes been known as Lake Bala, and Llyn Bochlwyd as Lake Australia.Should some place names be written only in Welsh?Translation error directs drivers to 'town egg gas'U-turn on street signs means they will be in Welsh Carwyn Powell said he felt ""stranded"" after Spot the collie disappeared. The Pet Abduction Bill will not apply to Wales as animal welfare is a devolved matter. The Welsh government said to ensure its resources have most impact in delivering its animal welfare plan, Wales will not be included in the bill.Currently, pet theft is classed under the Theft Act, meaning that a stolen pet is treated as inanimate property under the law. The Pet Abduction Bill, brought forward by Conservative MP Anna Firth, will make it a specific offence to abduct a pet in England and Northern Ireland.Under the new legislation, anyone convicted of the offence could face a fine or a maximum of five years in prison.But as animal welfare is a devolved matter, it is up to the Senedd to bring forward similar measures in Wales.Mr Powell's Collie, Spot, went missing in December 2018.Despite an extensive search, Spot has not been seen since. Mr Powell, 58, from Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire, said losing Spot was devastating. ""It's like losing a member of the family,"" he said. ""When we are doing something at home, you know there's somebody missing. When a dog's been stolen, there's no closure at all on it. You don't know what's happened to her. ""Mr Powell said that the law as it stands was not strong enough to tackle pet thefts. ""Something needs to be done about it because people are left just stranded really. There's no assistance coming from anywhere but in England and [Northern] Ireland now, they will have a bit of assistance if this bill goes through Parliament, but in Wales, there's nothing forthcoming. ""A pet theft taskforce was set up following a rise in pet thefts during the pandemic, and an abduction bill was one of its recommendations. Former Welsh Secretary and MP for South Swindon, Sir Robert Buckland, who was a member of that taskforce, said: ""The trouble with the Theft Act is that it deals with property and a lot of people think of pets as more than just property. ""We want families to enjoy the protection of the law and that's why abduction is a much better way of looking at it than treating animals as mere property. ""Sir Robert called on the Welsh government to enact a similar change, and said pet owners in Wales ""should not be put in a different position"" to those in other parts of the UK.Debbie Matthews, co-founder of the Stolen and Missing Pets Alliance, which began calling for reforms to the law a decade ago, said: ""It must be terribly worrying for the people in Wales. ""I know Scotland are putting through a dog theft law, if Wales aren't, does that mean that Wales is going to become the hotspot for taking dogs and cats? ""RSPCA Cymru is concerned that pets in Wales could be targeted more in other parts of the UK. Billie-Jade Thomas of RSPCA Cymru said: ""We hope that the Welsh government will continue to monitor the situation and that the decision that they have made is the result of an evidence-based approach. ""RSPCA Cymru recommends the following measures for owners to safeguard their pets: A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We want all animals to have a good quality life. We are delivering this through our programme of ambitious reforms set out in our animal welfare plan. ""Our focus is on areas which will bring greatest benefit to animal welfare across Wales, including our current consultation on licensing animal welfare establishments, exhibits and activities. ""To ensure our resources have the maximum impact on animal welfare, Wales won't be included in the scope of the Pet Abductions Bill"".More on Politics Wales on BBC One Wales, Sunday, 10:00 GMT, and on iPlayerCat and dog theft set to be made criminal offenceMen who bred puppies in sheds in £300k ring jailedPolice use DNA profiling to stop dog thefts Bedford Borough Council said six buildings have now been repaired along the High Street where new paving was unveiled in 2021.The High Street Heritage Action Zone (HSHAZ) Programme began four years ago.Vincent Decamps, from Maison Le Vôtre, said he chose Bedford over St Albans as the place to open his patisserie and bakery because of the restorative work.He said the renovations to the High Street and Silver Street, where he is based, brought ""uniformity"" and marked a ""new start for Bedford"".When looking for a location ""the first goal was to go to St Albans"", he said, and when he first looked around Bedford it was ""a no, no"". ""The only thing that attracted me to this position was the renovation of the building itself; if it was not restored I would have gone to St Albans, period, simple as that,"" he said.He said he ""took a massive risk"" and the area was now welcoming customers ""who haven't been in Bedford for two, three, four, five and six years"".The restoration programme, which started in January 2020, was a joint project between the council and Historic England, in partnership with Bedford BID and SEMLEP, and had been ""instrumental in preserving and enhancing the historic fabric of Bedford's town centre"", the council said. Two new businesses had moved into ""units that have been long term vacant"", the authority added.A new display celebrating its completion and featuring photographs, artwork, and information about the evolution of the town's High Street has opened at The Higgins Bedford - and runs until 1 April.Bedford's Evolving High Street exhibition ""offers a fascinating journey through the decades, showcasing the transformation and vitality of our beloved High Street"", the council said.

""I agree with that and I really hope that Wednesday will see a change in the direction that Jeremy Hunt takes, particularly on investment on capital so we that we can invest in our infrastructure, things like affordable housing. ""Ms Robison added taxes should not be reduced as the UK economy had gone into recession and called for the £1.6bn cut to Scotland's five-year capital budget to be reversed.The Scottish government's budget passed its final vote at Holyrood on Tuesday.Ms Robison said her £59.7bn spending plans would protect frontline services and include funding for a council tax freeze.But opposition parties warned the measures could harm economic growth and they criticised cuts for affordable housing.The finance secretary described the budget as ""really challenging"" and said she had to make ""difficult choices"".And she said the affordable housing cuts were linked to UK government cuts in both capital funding and financial transaction funding.Ms Robison added: ""I have said it is the number one issue that I want to address if I get that additional capital from the Spring Budget on Wednesday. ""She also said the one-year freeze on council tax was an intervention designed to help with household budgets during the cost of living crisis.So far 30 of Scotland's 32 local authorities have set their budgets but only two - Argyll & Bute and Inverclyde - have confirmed they will put taxes up for 2024/25.Ms Robison told The Sunday Show: ""We are providing £210m to local authorities to help them freeze the council tax and we expect that council tax payers get some benefit out of that investment. ""The minister added that, given the current financial climate, she believed local authorities had been ""treated fairly"".Scottish Conservative finance spokeswoman Liz Smith later criticised her comments.She said: ""It's ridiculous of Shona Robison to be giving the UK chancellor advice on growth, when the SNP's dire record led to her savage tax-and-axe budget that means Scots will be paying more to receive fewer and worse services. ""It's even more absurd for her to call for housing investment, when she has just cut Scotland's housing budget by 26%, and Shelter Scotland say the SNP are 'gaslighting' the public on the subject. ""Ms Smith also described the handling of the council tax freeze as ""shambolic"".She added: ""Her financial incompetence has left councils so desperate that they are appealing directly to the UK government. ""Meanwhile, Scottish Labour's finance spokesman Daniel Johnson said he was ""very uncomfortable"" with the situation faced by local authorities after the council tax freeze announcement.He told The Sunday Show: ""We had a pledge that was driven by the need to give the first minister a talking point at his conference in the autumn. ""Ever since then they have been playing catch up, leaving our councils in utter chaos. ""Mr Johnson also condemned the decision to put plans on hold to build new hospitals, surgeries and a network of treatment centres in Scotland. Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said ahead of the 6 March announcement that there was ""too much waste in the system"".As part of the reforms, AI will be used to cut NHS scan times by a third and the police will deploy drones to incidents such as traffic collisions.Labour said the package amounted to ""spin without substance"".Elsewhere, Mr Hunt also hinted that civil service staff numbers could be cuts by tens of thousands. The Treasury is hoping that the proposed technological reforms will deliver as much as £1.8bn worth of benefits to public sector productivity by 2029. ""There is too much waste in the system and we want public servants to get back to doing what matters most: teaching our children, keeping us safe and treating us when we're sick,"" Mr Hunt said. ""That's why our plan is about reaping the rewards of productivity, from faster access to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for patients to hundreds of thousands of police hours freed up to attend burglaries or incidents of domestic abuse. ""The announcement comes as Mr Hunt is under mounting pressure from his Conservative colleagues to deliver tax cuts when he unveils his Budget on Wednesday.The Treasury said the latest move would mean 130,000 patients a year - including those waiting for cancer results - would receive their completed tests quicker as a result of at least 100 MRI scanners in England being upgraded with AI.In policing, it said the reforms would help to deliver on the Police Productivity Review, which it said found up to 38 million hours of officer time could be saved every year.Other key measures in the £800m investment include:Darren Jones, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Nothing in Britain is better off after 14 years of Conservative economic failure. ""Millions of people are stuck on hospital waiting lists, our schools are crumbling and our streets are less safe. And yet all the chancellor is offering is more spin without substance. ""The BBC's Faisal Islam said the Budget came at a time when the government was hoping to have scope to unveil voter-friendly tax cuts ahead of the general election.It initially hoped for ""headroom"" of about £30bn to spend at the start of the year after its borrowing costs fell sharply, but the BBC understands this figure returned to its November level of roughly £13bn by the middle of last month. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Hunt acknowledged the latest forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility had broadly ""gone against us"". ""So it's going to be a Budget where we stress... the importance of being responsible with the country's finances, because it's fundamentally unconservative to fund all the things that you would like to do by borrowing money for future generations,"" he said. Paul Jonson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC that any tax cut in the Budget was ""likely to be undone after the next election, whoever wins"". He added: ""Whatever the scale of the tax cut announced this week, during this parliament taxes will have risen very substantially indeed. ""Mr Hunt also said the government would look to further cut public sector costs by reducing the number of staff in the civil service back to pre-pandemic levels.According to the Institute for Government, staff levels rose from around 423,000 at the start of 2020 to 496,150 in September last year. ""You had a huge expansion of [the] civil service during the pandemic that was justified,"" the chancellor said. ""It was an exceptional situation, but we're not in a pandemic now.

Marco Longhi, a Conservative MP who represents Dudley North in the West Midlands, defended him and said he should not have been suspended from the party. He said there was no evidence his friend was Islamophobic or racist and that he should be re-instated.The Ashfield MP was suspended from the Tory party after he refused to apologise for the remarks, which the prime minister's official spokesperson said were wrong. Mr Longhi told Politics Midlands: ""I think where there might be a slight weakness in his argument is making an assertion that Sadiq Khan is closely associated to Islamist and therefore, by inference, an Islamist himself. ""I think it's right that Lee works this out and I would like to see him return in the Conservative fold as soon as possible."" Lee Anderson has represented Ashfield since 2019Mr Longhi made the remarks during a debate about so-called no-go zones.Another Conservative MP, Paul Scully, apologised last week for suggesting there were ""no-go"" areas in parts of London's Tower Hamlets and Sparkill in Birmingham. The Dudley North MP said those comments were wrong but it did not show the Conservatives were out of touch. Mr Longhi said he represented a diverse community and there was not a corner of the United Kingdom he would personally describe as a no-go zone.

Mr Hunt is under pressure from some Tory MPs to reduce taxes in Wednesday's Budget, ahead of an election which must be held by the end of January. A further cut to National Insurance is believed to be among the measures being considered by the chancellor.In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Hunt said the Budget, when the government sets out its plans for tax and spending, would be about ""long-term growth"". He said he also hoped to ""show a path"" towards a lower-tax economy. ""We've been very consistent, that we would only cut taxes in a way that was responsible and prudent,"" he said. ""The most unconservative thing I could do would be to cut taxes by increasing borrowing. ""Overall the amount of tax people pay is still on course to reach record levels, despite the main rate of National Insurance being cut from 12% to 10% in last year's Autumn Statement. Mr Hunt has repeatedly hinted that he wants to reduce taxes further in the Budget but in recent weeks he has suggested there is likely to be less scope for this than he had hoped. With only 72 hours until the Budget, Mr Hunt was firmly in the damping down expectations mode.At the start of this year, the government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had estimated the chancellor had about £30bn of ""headroom"" to spend in the Budget, after borrowing costs fell sharply.Since then, borrowing costs have begun to rise again and by the middle of last month, the BBC understands the figure was back to its November level of roughly £13bn.With the government's spending rules and the OBR breathing down his neck on one side, and the Tory backbenches who want the historically high taxes cut, it is not a comfortable position. However, there is wide expectation at Westminster that he will reduce some taxes, even if the moves are not significant. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said: ""The chancellor says he wants to cut taxes, but it is the Tories who have raised taxes to their highest level in 70 years. ""No matter what the chancellor does in the Budget this week, working people will be worse off thanks to 14 years of Tory failure. ""Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, told the BBC that any tax cut in the Budget was ""likely to be undone after the next election, whoever wins"".The IFS has also warned that further reducing taxes is likely to mean spending cuts in the future.Asked if the government should be spending more on public services, rather than tax cuts, Mr Hunt said: ""I think what most people want is better public services and a lower tax burden. ""The only way that we have a chance of delivering something like that is by spending the money that we spend on public services much more efficiently."" The government has already announced an £800m package of reforms aimed at freeing up NHS and police time, for example using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to cut NHS scan times and drones to assess incidents such as traffic collisions.Former chief economist at the Bank of England Andy Haldane told the programme he thought the government's self-imposed spending limits - known as ""fiscal rules"" - were ""stunting"" economic growth and constraining the chancellor's decisions.These include getting debt as a proportion of the size of the economy falling in five years. Mr Hunt said he did not agree the government should change its fiscal rules because ""people would interpret that as Britain losing control of its finances"". Recent memories of the meltdown in the financial markets following Liz Truss's mini-Budget in 2022 - which included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - are a reminder of why such rules exist. But there does seem to be growing disquiet that the system that is meant to guarantee stability can have a negative impact too. Meanwhile, the chancellor is also considering other measures to raise revenue, including a new tax on vapes and scrapping non-dom tax status. People with non-domiciled status are UK residents whose home for tax purposes is abroad. Under the current system, they do not have to pay UK tax on money they make overseas.Mr Hunt has previously defended the tax status, arguing it helps make the UK an attractive place for well-off people to live and work. Labour has pledged to abolish non-dom status and spend the money generated on schools and the NHS. If the party backs any tax cuts the chancellor announces, which they are expected to do, this would leave questions over how some of their spending pledges would be funded.Mr Hunt refused to comment on any potential changes to specific taxes.However, he told the BBC: ""The country sees through gimmicks and we are not going to do gimmicks on Wednesday.

Three Kent pits - Snowdown, Tilmanstone and Betteshanger - were in operation in 1984 when the 54-week dispute began.Protests were held against plans by the National Coal Board, supported by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to shut 20 ""unprofitable"" pits nationwide.The National Union of Miners' strike saw miners and police clash on the picket lines across the country.Eventually the Kent miners returned to work but the pits were destined for closure. Betteshanger was the last to close in Kent in 1989.Shaun Parry started working at Snowdown Colliery near Aylesham when he was just 16 years old. He said: ""It was 940m deep, and it was very, very hot. I think the nickname was Dante's inferno. I loved it. ""Mr Parry said he had been detained by police during the strike. ""I hadn't done anything. I was taken to the van and then they cable-tied you to a wire inside the van,"" he said. ""I was frightened. I was really frightened."" Kay Sutcliffe was married to miner Philip Sutcliffe and they lived in the pit village of Aylesham. She said no-one in the village broke the strike and everyone in Aylesham was ""organised and united"".For Mrs Sutcliffe, the strikes were a battle to save not just jobs, but a way of life. After seeing TV reports of miners' wives in Nottinghamshire calling for a return to work, women in Kent, led by Mrs Sutcliffe and others, travelled north to boost support for the stoppage.She penned poems which galvanized dozens of women to march in protest, while her speeches were heard by thousands. Mrs Sutcliffe said: ""I think we were the first women support group that actually publicly were noticed for doing an active thing like that. ""'How is it gonna affect the miners in our community? How is it gonna affect their families if they can't get a job anywhere?' That's the kind of thing I was talking about,"" she told BBC Politics South East.

""Councillor Stephen Philpott, for Peel Common, said he was concerned the grant would be lost if the project did not start this year.The council previously said it was confident work would start in May and be finished in September, protecting the area in time for the winter.Steve Fitzmaurice and Andy Pearce, representing Coastal Partners, gave an update on the Alverstoke, Seafield and Stokes Bay flood defence schemes at the council meeting.They said that while a contractor, West Sussex-based JT Mackley and Co Ltd, had been appointed to start work on flood defence structures at Forton, there was a budget shortfall on the other projects. The Alverstoke sea defences, in the pipeline since 2015, would see the flood risk reduced for 142 homes and businesses. Seafield was also highlighted as one of the three priority areas for a flood defence scheme with 80 homes and businesses at risk, but it has an £800,000 funding gap.Council leader Peter Chegwyn said he wanted the government to provide extra money.Coastal Partners was formed in 2012 to deliver a coastal management service across the coastlines of the local authorities in Havant, Portsmouth, Gosport, Chichester, and Fareham.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Jersey Post said the stamps capture the ""enduring spirit of the RNLI"".A lifeboat was first established in Jersey in 1830, with a volunteer team and a boat, kept near Havre des Pas. In 1884, the RNLI station in St. Helier was built at Albert Quay, where it still serves as the Island's RNLI headquarters. Images chosen for the Jersey stamps include St Heliers Tamar class lifeboat, the dramatic scenes of the rescue of the yacht Fanny and Sir William Hillary, who founded the RNLI in 1824.Jersey Post said the stamps were a tribute to the ""generations of courageous volunteers and the generosity of those who give to support their vital life-saving work"".The release includes a booklet featuring further information about Jersey RNLI.The stamps will be available to buy from all branches of Jersey Post from 4 March.

The special magic Kigali number is 9535171 Having spent the past five years on the idea, he said support for the project has now gathered. Mr Martyn cofounded the Connect 3 Million campaign, external to build the sub-seabed link in 2019, and the group has been lobbying decision-makers and politicians since.The Faroe Islands to the north of Scotland have a population of about 53,000 and spent hundreds of millions of pounds on a subsea tunnel network.A rail tunnel between Guernsey and France via Jersey would cost an estimated £5.6bn and take up to 10 years to build, according to the campaign group. Mr Dorey said making it easier for people to reach the Channel Islands would ""transform the future for everyone"". ""Our economies are strong but are being held back when we all need them to expand further. ""This innovation will herald a boom across financial services, tourism and beyond”.The roadshows are being held on 5 March in Jersey and 6 March in Guernsey. Speakers due to attend the roadshows include tunnelling experts Arild Sovik, network director of the Norwegian Tunnelling Society and Teitur Samuelsen, chief executive of the Faroe Islands’ public company.Connect 3 Million said the speakers will share  how the economic, social and cultural benefits the tunnels have brought to the Faroe Islands, can be replicated for the Channel Islands.

""That's what music is, translating pain into art,"" said Travon Powell [known as T Santana], 21, rapper for the project. He added: ""One thing I've realised is that the more authentic you are with how you feel about subjects like the Knife Angel - putting knives down and making people aware of the violence that goes on in their city - it makes people want to be more authentic themselves. ""When I started, I thought people were going to think certain things about me. But I think it's down to your perception and how you view life. ""If I think that, I come from a more authentic place with my music. ""The album was inspired by the Knife Angel project in Gloucester - a statue made of knives that young people had surrendered. The group made the music for the launch of the sculpture last year, and then went on to make the album.Mikel Medley, youth support manager for The Music Works, said it had been ""life-changing"" for the participants. ""Some of them have said they wouldn't know where they would be in their life if they wasn't doing music,"" he said. ""They probably would have got themselves into trouble or not be in a good well-being space. ""Coby, who does marketing for the project, said: ""To me, it was really important just because I got to convey a lot of the stuff that isn't spoken about so much. ""I think when it comes to the topic of knife crime we often talk about the fallout of what happens when all of these things come to a head. ""No one wants to address how we can limit the fallout that comes from kids not getting the right the opportunities or given the right belief systems that lets them steer away from that to begin with. ""I think this is a perfect embodiment of what can happen when you tell young people in general that they're capable of doing something more than what's expected of them based on societal norms.

Teenagers in Worcestershire told the BBC Politics Midlands programme that home study during lockdown, and increased stress, had left many struggling to cope with school routine.The council said it continued to work to support pupils and parents and ""remove any barriers"" preventing attendance.Overall attendance in the autumn had been up on last year, the authority added.At Baxter College in Kidderminster, where there are 900 students, the overall attendance rate remains 4% down on pre-pandemic levels, according to the principal.One pupil there said students were struggling to readjust after the absence enforced by Covid, with one day off easily stretching into more now things were back to normal. “At the start of the week people say ‘oh I’ll just miss the one day’,"" explained Tom, 18, a sixth form student. ""And then we get to Friday and people are like ‘I’ll have a long weekend'.”Tom said he believed home study during lockdowns made many unused to school routine. “Now suddenly everyone’s being told what to do, when you can eat, when you can go home - it’s definitely been a shock,"" he told the programme.Fellow student Katie, 17, added: “School got re-introduced and I felt like people couldn’t be bothered to come back in, because they felt 'if I can do this at home, surely there’s no need'.”Another 17-year-old, Tegan, said: “My attendance has definitely dropped. I feel like I personally don’t mind working from home, and I work better in the evenings."" The number of pupils persistently absent from school in Worcestershire has not returned to pre-pandemic levelsPrincipal Mat Carpenter said the drop-off was more marked in students on free school meals.Attendance was “not just a school problem"", he said, but a matter for support services and parents too. Additionally, the number of pupils missing more than half of school has risen sharply at Baxter College.“Where previously we would have one or two [pupils like that] in the whole school… we’re now looking at up to 6%,” Mr Carpenter said.Baxter College is not unique in the county. With a secondary school population of more than 36,000, an estimated 23.9% - 8,650 students - in Worcestershire have missed at least 10% of school days so far this academic year. Baxter's principal, Mat Carpenter, and the school's wellbeing lead, Stacey Hannan, said schools needed more support to raise attendanceBaxter’s wellbeing lead Stacey Hannan - who is leading efforts to build relationships with families - admitted progress could be slow.“It could take six to eight weeks of home visits, telephone conversations with parents, and meetings,” she explained.She said the long referral waits students faced for mental health support or neurodiversity assessments meant that often schools were limited in the help they could give.“I think the system in both of those areas is creaking”, added Mr Carpenter, calling for substantial investment.Keira, 15, praised the pastoral care offered at Kidderminster & District Youth Trust, and said she did not feel like she was being judged as in schoolFor 15-year-old Keira, who is not currently in mainstream education, “mental health is the main issue"" for being an absentee, along with a lack of support for such challenges.“I started to not go in as often… my mum kept pulling me out because of how bad I was getting,"" she said of her experience.After being referred to Kidderminster & District Youth Trust, she now has a weekly meeting with mentor Maisie Cook, who says she offers an ""open space"" for teenagers to talk about their emotions and education. Speaking generally, Ms Cook said: ""We see a lot of young people who have a lot going on behind closed doors. Covid has been massive. ""Former Schools minister Robin Walker MP said more investment was needed for a rising level of neurodiverse studentsLast year, a cross-party group of MPs called for the government to offer better support for pupils and schools.“I think I’d give them an A for effort, but they’re not there on achievement yet,” said Worcester's Conservative MP Robin Walker, chair of the House of Commons Education Select Committee. Tracey Onslow, cabinet member for education at Worcestershire County Council, said: ""We continue to work closely with education settings across the county to support pupils and parents, and where possible, remove any barriers preventing regular attendance.

Kent Wildlife Trust said the mix of longhorns and Sussex cows were welcomed to Scotney Castle, near Tunbridge Wells, on Thursday to create a ""wilder, more biodiverse"" area.Rebecca Rees, the castle's manager, said they were ""thrilled"" to be working with the trust on the initiative.Castle archives show the first Scotney herd was introduced in 1896.The trust said the grounds of the 14th-century castle and Victorian country mansion included a large, wooded estate where the cattle will work alongside an existing flock of sheep to enhance the National Trust's wilder grazing plans for the site.Ms Rees said: ""The diverse features of the 780-acre estate at Scotney makes it a haven for wildlife and our ambition is to help it thrive. ""She added conservation grazing on the SSSI (site of special scientific interest) will result in an increase of habitat that supports the native wildlife of Kent. ""It also continues the heritage of traditional breeds as part of a working estate,"" she added.Alison Ruyter, area manager for Kent Wildlife Trust, said the cattle have an ""exceptional ability"" to clear reeds, willow, young scrub, and bramble. ""They are renowned for their calm temperament and work together to look out for each other, even taking it in turns to look after the calves whilst others sleep and forage,"" she said.Kent Wildlife Trust has more than 800 cattle, sheep, ponies, pigs, and a herd of bison across many of the 90 nature reserves under their management as part of its Wilder Grazing Strategy.Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

It also comes at a time when passengers have faced disruption to services due to strikes by rail workers over the past 18 months.Traditionally, fares are hiked based on July's retail prices index measure of inflation, which in 2023 was 9%, plus an additional 1%.However, the increase in fares has been capped below this rate, and is lower than last year.Regulated fares cover about 45% of fares, including season tickets on most commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities.For example, if the 4.9% increase is applied, an annual season ticket from Brighton to London would jump £275 to £5,891, while one from York to Leeds would go up £135 to £2,899. While some people may have tried to buy their season tickets just before the price rise, here are five tips for getting the cheapest deals at any time of the year.Advance train tickets are usually released up to 12 weeks before your departure date, although some go on sale as far as 24 weeks in advance. These types of tickets are often the cheapest way to travel on the railways if you're happy to go during a fixed time. Sometimes they can be available to buy up to an hour before your journey.Personal finance website Money Saving Expert says that London North Eastern Railway (LNER) often releases advance tickets up to six months ahead for routes from stations north of York to London.Some ticket purchasing apps can send alerts to your phone as soon as tickets for a specified journey go on sale. Split ticketing means you can take the same number of trains you normally would for your journey, but can save money by splitting your journey into multiple tickets between the stations the service stops at on the way.Some websites like Split My Fare and Split Train Tickets do it for you without you having to work it out.Split My Fare says on average, customers save 26% by doing this - although it's not always possible on some journeys. Also, checking to see whether it is cheaper to buy two single tickets rather than a return might save you money. Rail cards can offer discounts when booking, though they cost money to purchase in the first place, so benefit those who travel often.There are several types of rail card available: national, regional, those for students and those for pensioners. For example, the 16-25 Railcard costs £30, is valid for one year and gives you one third off each ticket you buy.More information on the different types of railcard are here.You can get up to a third off the ticket price when travelling in groups of three to nine adults off-peak.The group must be travelling together, and individual rail cards cannot be used when booking a group ticket. Groups of over 10 people can also get discounts - contact the train company directly for those. Group off-peak day travelcards for London are also available, but the origin station on the ticket needs to be in fare zones one to nine.National flexible rail tickets could save passengers hundreds of pounds, says watchdog Transport Focus. The flexible season tickets will allow travel on any eight days in a 28-day period, with no need to select the days of travel in advance. Train companies have also introduced a range of flexible tickets aimed at commuters and workers who have seen their travel patterns change post-pandemic. The Flexi Season ticket will offer a minimum of 20% discount on an equivalent monthly season ticket, according to National Rail.For those making the same journey multiple times in a week regularly, monthly or season tickets can be cheaper. Check with your employer to see if they offer a season ticket loan to help you spread the cost, interest free.Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

""We quite often saw parents who delivered their children to school quite early in the morning, sort of trudging home,"" she said. ""We just thought wouldn't it be nice, because the church is still warm after Sunday. It's a space that's not being used on a Monday morning.

""It isn't the first Mr and Mrs Sarson-Rowe, who got married in the church a year ago, have done for the community. Earlier this year they purchased a five-acre field to stop it from being built on, so it could be kept as a community green space. ""People are very positive. It's not a bad way to start a week, "" said Mr Sarson-Rowe""We're also trying to keep the church doors open, so that people know the church is here every day, not just on Sundays. ""Reverend Jane palmer, vicar at Christ Church, said the coffee morning is helping to spread that message. ""For a number of years, we've been working on a plan to be more community minded, so that church isn't just about Sundays.

Planning permission was granted in 2022 for offices and a café on the neighbouring site of the historic Western Park Open Air School, which fell into disrepair after becoming the target of vandals and arsonists in the 17 years since it closed.That plan was met with a number of objections from the local community.Key concerns about the latest plan include the loss of park land, the loss of the car park, traffic and parking concerns and the harm to wildlife.A handful of supporting comments were also submitted, with those in favour saying it was good the council was doing this on brownfield land and it would help tackle anti-social behaviour to which some said the car park is ""prone"".Planning officers say the proposal has an ""exemplary and innovative design which should be welcomed"" and the new homes would help meet housing needs.In order to create space for the new homes, the Constance Jackson Centre, Parkfield and Club House buildings would be demolished, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Planning officers labelled the loss of the car park ""regrettable"" when it comes to the convenience of park users. However, they said there would still be ""informal"" parking for them along the park's main access road.The applicant will also be requested to make financial contributions towards improvements at Western Park, which includes improving the basketball facilities.Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

""Me and another friend, Pete Thompson, rolled up to the dining hall and there's only a couple of seats left, right next to the bald lad,"" he recalls. ""Most other boys sported long Cavalier locks, so he rather stood out. ""Some daft immaturity came over me and I was a bit unsure, as I took my seat next to Dave Myers, the lad with alopecia. ""He was completely welcoming and friendly, and we hit it off with a shared passion for art. ""Here began the lifelong friendship that took us to flat sharing in London to pursue our fine art degrees and all the adventures ahead. ""After school, the pair ended up as flatmates in Peckham, London. When they would travel back to Barrow to visit family and friends, Mr Twyford recalls Myers and Peter Thompson going to the market for fresh food and cooking up a feast for them all. ""Dave and Pete would cook for us until the early hours of the morning, all adventurous dishes,"" he said. ""He was very loveable, full of enthusiasm, the same off-screen as on-screen. ""I loved Dave, he always had some adventurous plan he was going to try. ""He was just full of enthusiasm and a zest for life. ""His favourite memory from their enduring friendship was going to Brixton to a big motorbike warehouse and Myers buying his first ever bike.However, he did not have a licence and Graham had to drive it, with Myers in the sidecar. When Myers got his licence, the pals went on trips back to Cumbria from London.Graham said: ""I remember it was a Cossack Ural 650cc with a sidecar. ""The picture was taken on an early trip up to the Lakes from London in 1978. ""We took it in turns to ride the bike with one helmet between us. ""Cumbria is one of the top culinary destinations outside London, with a total of 16 Michelin Stars across 13 restaurants.Simon Rogan runs L'Enclume restaurant in Cartmel, south Cumbria, which has three stars.He said Myers was a great ambassador for the county and helped grow its culinary reputation. ""He was always shouting from the rooftops about the produce and the people and he had a genuine love for the area,"" Mr Rogan said. ""I think he was proud of the restaurant scene and what was going on in the North West, predominantly in Cumbria. ""Myers also lived in Roa Island for many years.It is just over half a mile (1 km) south of the village of Rampside, at the southern most point of the Furness Peninsula in Westmorland and Furness and has a population of about 100.It is a tight-knit community and friends and neighbours are saddened by his loss, but remember the TV personality fondly.Former neighbour, Ian Honeyman said: ""It's sad news, I knew he'd been ill but I didn't realise it was as serious as that. ""We were both born in Devon Street and we used to joke about which part of the street did we come from, was it the rough end, that kind of thing. ""He never forgot Cumbria and I think he did such marvellous work publicising it, which was great. ""He was a real natural comic and such a lovely guy. ""Even those who did not know him personally were struck by his natural warmth and down to earth nature when they met him in the flesh.During a trip to Glenridding in the Lake District a couple of years ago, Olivia Clarke spotted two big motorbikes in a car park and her hopes were raised that they might belong to her two biking and cooking heroes. She said: ""We had a couple of minutes chat. They weren't filming, they were just on a boys' jolly, having lunch."" Ms Clarke said her overriding memory of the encounter was the pair's chemistry. ""It just stuck with me because their energy, even off-screen, was there, this was well before Dave was ill,"" she said. ""He had this smiley face, this look on him, this swagger and you just knew you could talk to him."" She said Myers' and King's connection was ""spectacular"". ""They didn't just turn the magic on, it was real and they actually finished each other's sentences, like an old married couple or a pair of comfy shoes. ""Malcolm Flynn, who was another one of chef's neighbours when he lived on Roa Island, said he regularly took photographs of the town and sent them to Myers.He said: ""I'd often walked round the park or go on the bridge and take shots for Dave and send them to him. ""If you saw him he would always stop and speak, he always had the time and was always cheerful. ""He was a true Barrovian and we will miss him.

The hearing, which was held between between 21 and 23 February, considered incidents from between 2018 and 2020.Simeon Wallis presented the Nursing and Midwifery Council's case, saying Mr Ainsworth's dishonesty was ""not limited to a single occasion"".Mr Wallis said the former director's actions were serious and effectively an attempt to evade responsibility for situations in which a direct risk of harm to patients had been created by an error of his judgement, even though no harm materialised.The panel said in January 2019 Mr Ainsworth failed to refer a child with sepsis, referred to as Patient A, instead providing the wrong information to the patient's mother and sent them to a pharmacy.Mr Ainsworth did not make a record of the conversation, and falsely reported that Patient's A's rash ""did fade"" and that the patient's mother declined a review, the panel added.In September 2019, the panel said Mr Ainsworth incorrectly interpreted the blood test results of another patient, asking them to attend a repeat blood test ""when they should have been asked to go to A&E immediately"".The trust issued a statement to confirm Mr Ainsworth had resigned from his role as director of strategy and partnerships, saying he ""leaves with our best wishes and we thank him for all that he achieved during his time with the trust"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

64k,100,"Star dunes - or pyramid dunes - are named after their distinctive shapes and reach hundreds of metres in height.They are found in Africa, Asia and North America, as well as on Mars - but experts had never before been able to put a date on when they were formed.Now scientists have discovered that a dune called Lala Lallia in Morocco formed 13,000 years ago.Star dunes are created by opposing winds that change direction. Understanding their age helps scientists understands those winds and unpick the climate of that era, says Prof Geoff Duller at the University of Aberystwyth, who published the research with Prof Charles Bristow at Birkbeck University.Lala Lallia (an indigenous Amazigh name meaning highest sacred point) is located in the Erg Chebbi sand sea in south-east Morocco. It is 100m high and 700m wide with radiating arms.After its initial formation, it stopped growing for about 8,000 years and then quickly expanded in the past several thousand years.Normally deserts can be identified in Earth's geological history, but star dunes were absent until now.Prof Duller says this may be because they are so large that experts did not realise they were looking at one distinct dune. ""These findings will probably surprise a lot of people as we can see how quickly this enormous dune formed, and that it is moving across the desert at about 50cm a year,"" he adds.The scientists used a technique called luminescence dating to work out the age of the star dune.The method calculates when the grains of sand were last exposed to daylight.Samples of sand were taken in the dark from Morocco and analysed in a lab in dim red light conditions similar to an old-fashioned photography workshop.Prof Duller describes the mineral grains in the sand as ""little rechargeable batteries"". They store energy within the crystals that comes from radioactivity in the natural environment.The longer the sand is buried under ground, the more radioactivity it is exposed to and the more energy it builds up. When the grains are exposed in the lab, they release the energy in light form and scientists can calculate their age.""In our dark laboratory, we see light from these sand grains. The brighter the light then the older the sediment grains and the longer it is since they've been buried,"" says Prof Duller.Other examples of these huge dunes include Star Dune in Colorado, North America, which is the joint-highest dune in the US, measuring 225m from base to top.Climbing these dunes is hard work, Prof Duller explains. ""As you climb, you go up two and slide back one. But it's worth it - they're absolutely beautiful from the top,"" he says.Killer whale vs shark: Solo orca eats great whiteMoon lander pictured on its side with snapped legUK power station still burning rare forest wood'Ice bumps' reveal history of Antarctic melting Firefighters attended the derelict premises, where Lisneal College was previously sited, on Drumahoe Road at 20:17 GMT. There are currently 50 firefighters at the scene, with seven pumping appliances and one aerial appliance.The fire is in a two-storey section of the building and operations are expected to continue for some time. An NIFRS spokesperson said: ""Local residents are advised to stay away from the area and keep windows and doors closed while the incident is ongoing."" Liz Kendall is expected to say the party will invest in careers and skills training but warn young people have a ""responsibility"" to take them up.The party warned the number of people aged between 16-24 who are not in work, education or training is rising.A Tory spokesman said Labour has an ""abysmal"" record on youth employment.According to Office for National Statistics estimates, there were 851,000 young people not in employment, education or training between October to December 2023.That number has risen by 20,000 compared to the same period in 2022 and accounts for 12% of all 16-24-year-olds.In a speech to the Demons think tank in central London, Ms Kendall will say the Tories have ""failed on the economy - and that is because they have failed on work"".She is expected to add: ""This is our commitment to young people. We value you. You are important. We will invest in you and help you build a better future with all the chances and choices this brings.""But in return for these new opportunities, you will have a responsibility to take up the work or training that's on offer. Under our changed Labour party, if you can work there will be no option of a life on benefits.""The party has not detailed whether it would introduce enforcement measures to back up its stance.Labour has previously pledged to invest in 1,000 new careers advisers, specialist mental health support in every school and so-called Young Future hubs in every area to provide a range of services to vulnerable young people.It says it would fund the changes by removing tax breaks for private schools and closing tax loopholes used by some private equity fund managers.The party plans to reform the apprenticeship levy - a 0.5% tax on large employers - to invest in skills training.Ms Kendall is further expected to say on Monday that Labour would ""overhaul access to work"" for disabled young people if it wins the next election.In response, a Conservative Party spokesman pointed towards the previous record of Labour governments on youth employment.The Tories have also attacked Labour's plan to reform the apprenticeship levy in order to fund its policies, saying it would lead to a reduction in the number of people getting on-the-job training.A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Under the last Labour government, youth unemployment almost doubled and the number of people seeking out-of-work benefits soared - their abysmal record speaks for itself.""When is the Budget and what will it mean for my money?Hunt: Childcare plan on track but no guaranteesI will only cut taxes in responsible way - HuntWe must face down extremists, says Rishi Sunak More than 160 councils have warned that thousands of vulnerable families are facing a cliff edge of support without the Household Support Fund.But the government says other benefits are rising to help cover living costs.The Asemotas are just one of the hundreds of thousands of families who have received help from the fund.Its closure is ""going to be a really sad moment"", says Israel Asemota. ""It's just going to be another kick for our family.""Over the past two and a half years £2.5bn has been given out through the Household Support Fund.The safety net funds food banks, warm spaces and provides direct cash for those in need.When the Asemotas had triplets, Israel reduced his hours at work to help care for the children alongside his wife Oseratin, who is on maternity leave.""It's been a relief to get the help, but we know it will still be a struggle in the months and years ahead,"" he says. Looking at his three two-month-old babies, he adds: ""You're taking it from them"".Osaretin says the couple were ""so grateful"" to get support through the fund.The grant they received from Oldham Council came through Homestart Host, and they have been able to spend it on baby formula, nappies and energy bills to keep the house warm enough for the three newborns.Her husband Israel said: ""We have never needed help before. We've both worked, and only ever depended on each other.""When asked what it felt like to receive the money Osaretin said: ""It was one of the best days, they brought food, they gave us vouchers, I was very happy because it wasn't going to be easy just depending on our income.""I am no longer working, and he has reduced his hours to 20 hours a week, so the money is really not coming in anymore.""The fund funnels government money to councils in England for projects targeted at those who are most in need.Lauren Forrester from Homestart Host said: ""For lots of families that we've supported it's meant feeding their children and heating their homes, just those really important but basic essentials, that you really need to raise small children.""Ruth Welford, assistant director for Barnardos, says that is a picture that has been repeated across the whole country. ""We know this is a scheme that has helped local authorities reach lots of families that have no way of feeding and clothing their children, and that cost of living crisis is not over for those families.""""It's critical that it continues,"" said Ruth ""Otherwise thousands of children will be plunged even deeper into poverty. It will be catastrophic.""Last month, more than 120 organisations wrote to Chancellor Jeremy Hunt to urge him to extend it for at least another year.A cross-party group of 160 councils in England has said the fund is a ""vital lifeline"" and have called for it to be extended.Councillor Shaun Davies, chair of the Local Government Association, says closing the fund risks more households falling into financial crisis, destitution, and homelessness. ""That increases pressure on already overstretched public services such as the NHS, social care and temporary accommodation,"" he says.The fund is due to end in four weeks' time, unless a turnaround is announced in the budget this week.In Liverpool there are thousands of households who get help from food banks and pantries each week, which are being funded via the Household Support Fund. ""It's enabled us to keep pushing the edge of the cliff further away for households across the city,"" says Naomi Maynard, the director of Feeding Liverpool. Her organisation supplies 84 different food banks in the area, which have faced a double-whammy of falling donations and rising prices for food which they now need to buy in themselves. ""The Household Support Fund is filling that gap,"" says Naomi. She says that as demand for help is still increasing: ""We'll be cutting ourselves off at the knees if we get rid of this funding at this crucial point when households are still struggling and are trying to recover"".But the government says that as the Household Support Fund ends, benefits and the Local Housing Allowance are rising to help cover living costs.A government spokesperson said: ""The current fund is available up until March 2024 as part of wider cost of living support worth on average £3,700 per household, including raising benefits by 6.7% from April and increasing the Local Housing Allowance.""For Israel, the dad of the triplets, his concern is that others won't get the help his family has been given.""I feel for those who are going to be in my own shoes,"" he says. ""This is one of the things that can really help.""What is happening to energy bills?Which debts and bills should I pay first?How can I keep my baby warm during cold weather? So people will be watching the National People's Congress to see what's on offer when it starts on Tuesday.Nearly 3,000 NPC delegates gather annually, for just over a week, inside Beijing's cavernous Great Hall of the People to pass laws, approve personnel changes and delegate the operation of government to smaller groups which meet throughout the year.It is, for the most part, a political performance which rubber-stamps decisions already made behind closed doors. But given that the messages delivered have been thought through by those in power, analysts will be looking out for any change in the official Party line and what it might mean for China and the world.For example, a certain new phrase might signal a change in industrial policy or a potential new law governing investment rules.Crucially, the lens through which to view all of this is that there is nothing more important to the Communist Party than ensuring the longevity of its rule in China. For the current leader, Xi Jinping, it is absolutely paramount in virtually all aspects of life.This has not seemed like much of a struggle in recent decades, as business boomed and living standards improved for most, year after year.But now Asia's engine of growth is locked in a real estate crisis which has dissolved the life savings of many families who paid for flats which were never delivered; it has armies of university graduates who can't find good jobs and it is burdened by huge amounts of local government debt, which has robbed policymakers of the ability to inject funds into infrastructure in the same way they used to be able to, whenever times were tough. It had been the case that a new road project, or a series of bridges, could soak up a lot of unemployment, unused steel and excess concrete capacity. But this is a period of much more uncertainty.""This year's NPC will be held at a time of unusual ferment and volatility, particularly over economic policy,""  says Richard McGregor, author of The Party, which examines China's structures of government.He told the BBC that there are ""rumours swirling about the government looking for a large statement of some kind to restore confidence and lift growth. There is widespread unhappiness about the state of the economy, and in turn about the direction Xi Jinping has set for the country"".In the past, when enormous changes generated great concern - like the flooding of entire historic areas to make way for the Three Gorges Dam project - there have been protest votes registered at the NPC. But it would take an exceptionally brave Party representative to try that under Xi Jinping.Mr McGregor said he doesn't expect denunciations of leadership during this Congress, as ""all of the delegates have learnt to stay very much on message"". However, he added that ""even critical murmurs will be significant"". Professor Ann Lee from New York University said the session could see legislation providing more support to the private sector. ""This is a tacit recognition that China's economy needs more entrepreneurial investment in order to meet Xi's high-quality growth goals,"" she said.A phrase Mr Xi has been using since the end of last year in reference to the direction of the country is ""new productive forces"". This is likely to be peppered through speeches in coming weeks as well.But what does it mean?Dr Jon Taylor from the University of Texas at San Antonio said that Mr Xi is referring to ""an emphasis on the development and commercialisation of technology and science, digitisation, and high-end manufacturing centring on emerging intelligent and eco-friendly technologies"".He added that, while this is a ""quite interesting catchphrase"", it is going to take time for these types of industries to take off, partly because ""these sectors of China's economy are relatively small"", and ""the problem is that China faces some serious challenges, thanks to an underperforming economy"".He said that the new emphasis on technological innovation may pay off in the long term, but that ""in the short term, China remains dependent on infrastructure spending and a wobbly property market"".One interesting aspect of Mr Xi's ""new productive forces"" was when he told the Politburo in January that such forces would be ""freed from traditional economic growth mode and productivity development paths"", which would seem to suggest that the coming high-tech breakthroughs could be organised by and for the Party.According to the former Chief Economist at multinational investment bank UBS, George Magnus, ""this emphasises the party's leadership, control and power to leverage 'new productive forces' for ideological work. This, in turn, means an industrial policy that serves to strengthen the Party's dominance in the economy's core digital and scientific spaces"".Professor Lee sees the use of this phrase as important because it shows that ""Xi is determined to reinvigorate the Chinese economy after setbacks from its real estate sector and the ongoing trade tensions with the West"" and said that it ""may signal a turning point"".This mass political gathering starts with a marathon speech from the Premier, in which he reads out the Government Work Report, which summarises - in a very formulaic fashion - how China has performed over the past 12 months over a wide range of areas: the economy, the environment, in agriculture and so on. Then it moves on to what the Party's plan for the next year is. This is a key place to pick up any shifts in government thinking, but a magnifying glass may be required to spot it amongst the mountain of jargon.During the NPC, there will also be a series of highly choreographed press conferences in which only screened questions are permitted and virtually all answers rehearsed. Over recent years, the Party has also placed fake foreign correspondents into these press briefings, who seemingly represent the international media but are really from front companies based overseas but controlled by Beijing.""The days of relatively candid press conferences from various ministries and provincial delegations on the sidelines of the Congress are pretty much gone,"" said Mr McGregor.This vast meeting may be an elaborate show - with loyal delegates head down in turgid reports - but that doesn't mean it will be without important developments.According to Dr Taylor, ""while the Congress tends to be a decidedly performative autocratic exercise, there are elements of policy innovation and promulgation that bubble up"".These are trying times for China, he said. The country ""faces several challenges that it will continue to struggle with this year: encouraging foreign direct investment in the midst of decoupling, systemically addressing local government debt, restoring private sector confidence, developing greater technological and scientific self-reliance, and ramping up consumer demand"".There are significant problems facing this superpower and the moment for answers is upon it.This video can not be playedWATCH: Why China's president gets two teacups...in 59 seconds But after 24 February 2022, the girls and their families scattered across Europe.For two years, they have connected almost entirely online, using Telegram and Snapchat. ""Many of us feel overwhelmed by the loss of friends and the inability to meet them,"" Yuliia says.Incredibly, though, they did see each other again in person last summer, in their bombed-out hometown for a school prom.Now, their stories, and those of other Ukrainian women, are being told in a photography exhibition in London.When they fled Ukraine, the teenagers hoped it would be temporary, as Yuliia tells me they thought ""it would take just a few months and we would all go back to Ukraine and back to our lives"".She originally moved with her mother and grandparents to Bulgaria, where a friend lent them a holiday flat. They later moved to Poland.Aliesia's journey was more intense. She spent weeks travelling by bus and train, staying in tents and hostels, moving from Romania to Switzerland, then France and Spain, before arriving in Krakow, Poland, in May 2022.The whole experience ""was not as physically stressful as it was emotionally"", Aliesia says.With her mother, 13-year-old brother, 17-year-old cousin and aunt, they moved into a one-room dormitory. The children did online schooling on their bunks, with teachers who had remained in Mykolaiv. Sofiia left Ukraine for Katowice in Poland first. The journey took several days. ""There wasn't a place to stay for the night, my mum wasn't sleeping for three days, there was no food at the gas stations.""Seven of them, including her mother and her cousin, lived in one bedroom.""It was really difficult.""Sofiia loves dancing and music. She would practise on the outdoor public piano on a street in Katowice. ""I didn't have one at home. I'm really very extroverted, so it was great.""The family have since moved to Switzerland, where she is studying 10 subjects at a prestigious school.Her father died of Covid during the pandemic. Aliesia and Yuliia had to leave their dads behind in Ukraine because men over the age of 18 are banned from emigrating.Aliesia and her father were reunited when the family moved back to Ukraine at the end of 2022. Six months into the war, her mother and aunt found that the hotel cleaning jobs they had in Poland didn't pay enough to cover rent and other bills.Photographer Polly Braden has tracked the families' experiences over two years and is about to tell their stories in an exhibition, Leaving Ukraine, at the Foundling Museum in London. After watching reports from inside Ukraine about the men going to war and what they faced, ""it felt really important to see what the women were doing and what was happening outside Ukraine"", she says.So she followed the young people as they have built new lives to find out, ""what would that be like for them?""They have had to grow up fast.Sofiia says ""very quickly we stopped being teenagers and had to start our life as adults"".Aliesia tells me the ""teenage dream"", the one you see ""in American movies"", has been taken from them. ""I have sometimes had pretty bad mental breakdowns… It was not fair that I can't enjoy life the same way as people my age from other countries do.""Yuliia says it has ""felt very isolating, especially as everyone else in the world is still living their lives like nothing happened"".But none of the girls come across as self-pitying. As Sofiia puts it: ""It's not only difficult for us.""Aliesia adds: ""We have to sometimes just accept some things we cannot change.""With school friends spread far and wide, last year they began to talk about wanting to have a school prom when their Ukrainian schooling ended.""For such a long while, our friend group was separated, our whole class was separated,"" Yuliia says. ""So seeing everyone, almost everyone, was really important to all of us.""Sofiia began planning her outfit. ""If you want to get a prom dress in Switzerland or Italy, it's very expensive."" She and her mum decided ""it would be cheaper to go to Ukraine"". So after school one Friday, Sofiia took a 20-hour bus trip to Lviv, in western Ukraine. She found a gold dress that ""was really perfect"", bought it, and took the long journey back to Switzerland.The prom couldn't be held at their school, which had been bombed.Instead, they hired a local hall. Bombs fell on Mykolaiv a couple of days before the reunion, which made the decision to return difficult because they were ""a bit scared"", Sofiia says.But about 20 teenagers went back for the prom, from new homes as far away as the UK, Austria, Poland, Germany, Belgium and Switzerland. They came to dance, party and try to be normal teenagers for just one night.""It was actually much more special than just being a normal teenager, because a prom is quite a special day in anyone's life,"" Yuliia says. ""We all felt beautiful and it was kind of magical.""She spent two days getting to Mykolaiv from Poland. ""I was very excited.""She also got to see her father for the first time since she had left Ukraine.Sofiia's mother drove for three days to get them back home, sleeping by the roadside when she felt tired. Everyone understood why it meant so much.""The war wasn't planned and so our lives stopped in one moment,"" Sofiia says. ""I think it was really very important to have the ending of our school lives, of our teenage lives.""It was an emotional evening, according to Aliesia. ""Especially by the end, when we had to say goodbye to each other and realise that we won't see each other for a long time again.""But for one night, they drank punch (""mildly alcoholic"" and ""so tasty"", according to Yuliia), danced and sang to Maneskin (Alesia's ""favourite band""), listened to speeches, and as the sun rose in the early hours, went out for a walk.""In the morning, we all felt sad,"" Sofiia says, ""because it was totally the end of school life.""Polly Braden's exhibition Leaving Ukraine is at the Foundling Museum in London from 15 March. Brisbane Broncos' Ezra Mam says Spencer Leniu called him a ""monkey"".When asked about the complaint after the match, the Sydney Roosters prop said ""nothing"" had happened and ""it's all just fun and games on the field"".Australian sports have been battling a wave of racist abuse from crowds, but incidents between players are uncommon.National Rugby League (NRL) officials are investigating the claim, which has overshadowed the start of the season.The two teams were facing off in at Allegiant Stadium on Saturday local time - the same venue as last month's Super Bowl - as part of a marquee round aimed at enticing a US audience to Australia's top-tier competition.During the game, which the Broncos lost 20-10, Mam can be heard telling the referee of the alleged slur, with another teammate repeating the accusation.The referee said he did not hear the language, but made a formal complaint at Mam's request.Leniu has been charged with breaking the sport's behaviour code and will face a judiciary panel, which will hear evidence and can impose penalties including fines and match bans.After the game, Broncos coach Kevin Walters said Mam was ""adamant"" the slur had been used and was ""pretty upset"".""In this day and age, you wouldn't think this is still out there,"" team captain Adam Reynolds added.""We certainly don't stand for racism and we'll support Ezra and get around him, make sure he's all right.""The coach of the Roosters, Trent Robinson, said he hadn't spoken to Leniu about the allegation.""[Mam] obviously made the complaint, but that doesn't mean that it's right. It'll go through the formal process, as it should,"" he said.Local media have also reported that Mam's teammates later had a verbal argument with Leniu over the incident, in corridor at the hotel both sides were staying at.In recent years, the NRL has struggled to address racist abuse directed at players by spectators.Players including South Sydney Rabbitohs star Latrell Mitchell have regularly reported vitriol, both online and during games.Mitchell - who is also the Indigenous All Stars captain - posted to Instagram on Sunday supporting Mam and demanding action from league officials.""I stand with you,"" he said.NRL leaders have vowed to eradicate racism from the sport, and say that anyone who racially abuses or threatens players will be reported to police.Australian footy faces same racism storm 30 years on In the 2023 Budget, he announced measures - including on growth, inflation and childcare - which were highlighted in a government press release.How has the government got on with delivering them? Mr Hunt introduced his speech on 15 March 2023 as ""a Budget for growth"".But, according to official figures, the economy has not grown since.For the rest of 2023, there was zero growth followed by a 0.1% and a 0.3% contraction - meaning the UK economy entered recession.Mr Hunt highlighted a forecast from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) that inflation would be halved by the end of 2023. When he delivered his Budget, inflation was still above 10% and it did indeed halve, reaching 4% by the end of the year.The chancellor announced that from 1 August 2023 he was going to make Draught Relief more generous, describing pubs as a ""treasured community institution"".It applies to alcoholic drinks such as beer and cider that are below 8.5% ABV and can be served on draught. The relief reduced the tax on them by 9.2%. Mr Hunt said: ""we're protecting the price of a pint"". But beer prices have continued rising. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said they were up 7.5% in January 2024 compared with the same month last year, with prices increasing every month of the year, despite draught relief. But that was still a smaller increase than beer from shops, which went up 8.6% in the same period. Emma McClarkin, the British Beer and Pub Association's chief executive said the cut in duty ""has been a valuable boost to brewers and pubs"" but called for further cuts to beer duty.BBPA figures show that almost exactly the same number of pubs closed in the UK in the second half of 2023 (266) as had closed in the first half (265). One of the biggest measures was free additional childcare.From April 2024, eligible two-year-olds in England will be entitled to 15 hours a week of childcare during term time - more than 100,000 working parents have registered for this. There have been concerns that technical glitches and delays may prevent them accessing the scheme.There have also been warnings of staff shortages. BBC analysis estimated that demand is likely to rise by about 15% - equivalent to more than 100,000 additional children in full-time care once children as young as nine months are eligible in September 2025.The think tank Nesta estimates that about 27,500 early-years professionals would be needed in England to meet this. Total childcare staffing in England increased by almost 13,000 overall between 2022 and 2023.That was driven by an increase in staff at private providers and in school-based nurseries. However, childminders and staff in voluntary groups are continuing to fall, with 5,600 fewer in 2023 than in 2022.In February, the government launched a campaign to recruit more staff, but early-years charities said it would be too late to help.Education Secretary Gillian Keegan has said she is confident that the extra childcare will be delivered from April.One of the ways that Mr Hunt said he was going to promote growth was by helping people back into work, including those not working due to disability or long-term sickness.His measures included apprenticeships for over-50s, abolishing the lifetime pension allowance and sanctioning benefits claimants who choose not to take up a reasonable job offer. He said: ""excluding students, there are over seven million adults of working age who are not in work"".We asked the Treasury about which figures he was quoting and were told it was the figures for December to January 2023, taking all the people who are not working and subtracting students, although that actually gives a figure closer to eight million.The official figures show that figure has fallen slightly, but there have been changes to the data that mean they are not strictly comparable.Mr Hunt also announced measures on energy bills including stopping people who use prepayment meters having to pay more for their energy than those paying by direct debit.""The energy premium paid by our poorest households is coming to an end,"" Mr Hunt said.And he has done this, in two stages - initially he changed the Energy Price Guarantee to temporarily remove the difference.Then in February 2024, the regulator Ofgem announced that from April it was removing the differences in standing charges that had previously been paid by those using prepayment meters. One of the big Budget 2023 announcements was ""full expensing"", allowing companies to deduct the full amount they invest in equipment and machinery from their profits.It means for every pound a company invests, its taxes are cut by up to 25p.""Its impact on our economy will be huge,"" Mr Hunt said, citing the OBR as saying it would increase business investment by 3% a year.The policy came into force on 1 April 2023. The level of business investment for the whole of 2023 was 6.1% higher than it had been in 2022.Karl Williams, research director at the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS) welcomed this increase, saying: ""Business investment has been flat for years, contributing to weak economic growth."" He said it was too soon to say what proportion of the increase was due to full expensing, but predicted that it would eventually increase it by about 1.5% a year. We asked the Treasury to comment on the delivery of the 2023 Budget measures.It said: ""Our childcare reforms will save parents up to £6,500 on average, and because of our long-term decisions - including cutting taxes for 29 million people and an £11bn tax cut for business - we are forecast to permanently add 0.5% of output to the UK economy and increase the number of people in work by around 200,000.""

Her father died during the pandemic, and she was unable to be with him, so started the Milton Keynes-based group to help others. ""Many of the bereaved were unable to gather at funerals and to be with their loved ones and for many it will be the first time they will be able to come together with others who understand what that grieving process was,"" she said.Chinwe Osaghae, a special needs teacher and community artist in Milton Keynes, said she had ""seen extensively"" the impact the pandemic has had on the community. ""Adults are living with fear, depression and hopelessness,"" she said.""That hung like a cloud over people in the pandemic, and that has been passed on to the younger people.""Sisters Claire Line and Karen Arundle came to honour their 84-year-old mother, who died during the first Covid-19 lockdown.Ms Line said they made the 45-minute journey to the service to ""be there"" for her.Ms Arundle also wanted to remember her 42-year-old friend who died in the pandemic. Sam Royston, a director for policy and research at Marie Curie, said: ""The Covid pandemic was such a traumatic experience for us all but for the millions of people who were bereaved over the course of the pandemic, the impact of that is likely to be lifelong.""Taking a moment to commemorate, through events like the one we're holding today, is so important to not just acknowledge those that have died but to acknowledge their lives.

Mr Smith created an intricate set mirroring a branch line in the Forest of Dean 10 years ago. The model starts at Cannop Colliery and finishes in Parkend. Robert Smith's son bought him the first instalment of the model railway and it snowballed from thereUnfortunately, Mr Smith was unable to completely finish the project, but it is still on display at his widow's house in Coleford.The model railway is so large, there were discussions in the family to extend it through a wall into another section of the house.Mr Smith had limited modelling abilities when he started but was determined to keep the layout faithful to the Forest. Bob Smith said: ""It took over his life, he suddenly dedicated all his spare time left to working on this railway.""The difference it made to Dad was colossal. ""He was only alive another five, six or seven years after starting the system and it made a huge difference. It can't be quantified, really.""Robert was passionate about keeping the layout faithful to the Forest of Dean Hanari, 42, lives in Bristol and had a stroke in 2018.Her husband Takura said he noticed an ""immediate improvement"" after Hanari took part in the programme.""She was making her voice heard and we learned how to help her,"" he told BBC Radio Somerset.He added that there had been a ""big difference"" between Hanari before and after her stroke.""She went from someone who was very talkative and bubbly to someone dealing with language issues,"" Takura said.The Queen Square Intensive Comprehensive Aphasia Programme was funded by the National Brain Appeal charity.John Bentley, the lead speech and language therapist for the programme, worked closely with Hanari.He said it can take up to 100 hours of treatment to regain language skills after a stroke.The NHS only offers 12 hours of speech therapy on average to stroke victims.""We take communication for granted, but after a stroke, it can massively affect our relationships,"" Mr Bentley said.""It can leave us unable to be the same person.

""There was no mention that Noonan syndrome could affect people differently. ""It was scary. We found, and still find, we are the ones having to explain what Noonan syndrome is to medical professionals.""Dad Terry says Matilda is ""thriving"". Though she has health issues, Matilda is walking, eating solid foods, and doing many of the things the Fays were told she would never be able to.Dr Catherine Coveney, research lead, said: ""Very often medical professionals don't know much about Noonan syndrome, if anything at all. ""Families have told us of poor support, lack of understanding and difficulties accessing care.""This, coupled with the fact that teachers, social workers, family, and friends have never heard of the condition, families feel like they are on their own.""Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

""That's how quick it was for everybody.""Ms Devine said her mother was sitting up and chatting away happily in her hospital bed, albeit with an oxygen mask on.But she added: ""They showed us the X-ray of her lungs and said it had ferociously attacked her lungs and she wasn't coming out.""Ms Devine said she gave her mum her last rites by speaking to the local priest over the phone, as he could not come into the hospital with her.She added: ""Giving your mum the last rites is an honour, but it's not an honour anyone wants.""The sisters said goodbye and planned to visit the next day, but the former nursery teacher died in the early hours of the morning.""We never got to see her again,"" said Ms Devine. ""You don't get the body.""Ms McCarron added: ""We had to wait 14 days before the funeral could take place and there were only ten of us allowed there.""The sisters said they visited the memorial on Sunday to keep their mother's memory alive.Ms Devine said: ""Everybody loses their mum and you know you're going to lose them at some point.""But I think you don't realise until you meet other people who lost their loved ones in the same circumstances, through the pandemic, and you know that they went through what you're going through.""Ms McCarron agreed and added: ""It's not finished for us.""For other people, now lockdown has finished, it's just a distant memory if they haven't lost anybody. But for us it's still there. ""You don't get the comfort from family that you would take for granted when somebody passes.""She said the memorial gave them a place to grieve with people who lost loved ones in the same circumstances.Ms McCarron added: ""You're the only ones who know what that was like, to do it on your own.""First Minister Humza Yousaf said he was very grateful to Marie Curie for holding a day of reflection ""to honour those who have died"".He added: ""Losing a loved one is one of the greatest challenges we will experience in life and the impact of the pandemic often made our grief even harder to bear.""

Wicked: Part One was the first film to be shot at Sky Studios Elstree and the musical is due in cinemas this autumn.On Wednesday, cross-party councillors voted to adopt two development consent orders (LDOs), which cover the studio and Panattoni Park Borehamwood, which Sky leases.Without LDOs, the studio would be required to submit planning permission for every new production.This is beneficial for a film studio, which often needs to build temporary structures such as marquees and portable buildings.Hertsmere Borough Council has previously adopted an LDO for the EastEnders set at BBC Elstree Centre, also in Borehamwood.Sky Studios Elstree may only use the LDOs ""to support and facilitate film and television production"".A list of permitted activities includes designing, building, decorating, storing and striking film sets, welfare and catering for crew, hair and makeup, and post-production.The orders set out that structures must not exceed a height of 15m (49ft) above ground level, except for hoarding and fencing, which has a limit of 5m (16ft).Hertsmere Borough Council is yet to rule on separate plans to expand the Sky Studios Elstree site.The company is planning a northern extension between Borehamwood's Rowley Lane and the A1, with 10 sound stages and a forecasted £2bn additional production investment into the UK's creative economy over the first five years of operation.A decision on the proposed extension is due in May.Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and X.

Carys Ashby set up a petition last year after learning the BBC programme was to end after almost 24 years. It gathered more than 8,000 signatures.  She said she felt sorry for the cast and crew, after filming for the drama ended on Friday, adding:  “I wanted to show them that we do care and this is how we feel.”The show had been affected by ""super inflation in drama production"", causing costs to rise significantly, the BBC said.

Its makers had not been afraid to tackle a range of issues, including breastfeeding and mental health, it argued. She said she used to watch the soap opera with her nan, who she also cared for.“I’d come back from college, do her lunch, and we’d watch it together,” she said.“I joined a fan group where I made a load of friends.""She said of the petition: “Sadly, it’s not enough but I felt like I had to try and do something.""Ms Ashby recently visited the set and was able to go behind the scenes and meet cast members.TV critic Scott Bryan, from the BBC's Must Watch podcast, said on X the show had ""been a training ground for many actors"".It has featured household names such as Eddie Redmayne, Sheridan Smith, Nicholas Hoult, Rustie Lee and Phoebe Waller-Bridge, he said.""For many of us, this is the show we would watch on our sick days,"" Mr Bryan added.Trade union The Writers' Guild called the decision ""a terrible loss to the UK writing community, and to audiences"".It said it was essential the UK ""continues to provide distinctive content and opportunities for our writers"".Meanwhile, people who have worked on the show have also expressed their sadness.Writer and director Joy Wilkinson wrote: ""I'd have left TV drama if it wasn't for this wonderful, warm and creative show.""She said the 36 episodes she had worked on ""were the making of me, as it formed many on both sides of the camera"".The BBC has thanked all the cast and crew who worked on the show which was first broadcast on 26 March, 2000. Doctors TV series cancelled after 23 yearsDoctors This video can not be played'Never in my wildest dreams' - Raye on her record seven Brit nominationsThe pop star, whose real name is Rachel Keen, has been barrelling about the record industry since she was a teenager. To a casual onlooker, it seemed like things were going well.She wrote for big names like Beyoncé, Little Mix and Charli XCX. She produced records for Rihanna and John Legend. She collaborated with Stormzy and David Guetta. Songs like You Don't Know Me and Secrets sold enough to buy her a house.But, as a solo artist, her music was constantly questioned and rejected. In 2021, five years after she signed a four-album deal with Polydor Records, the label was still refusing to release her debut.Not knowing what else to do, Raye posted a video message to social media, tearfully explaining her frustration.Dozens of potential hits were ""sat in folders collecting dust"", she said, while others were being given away to bigger stars ""because I am still awaiting confirmation that I am good enough"".""I've done everything [Polydor] asked me, I switched genres, I worked seven days a week,"" she said. ""They either listen to me now or we part ways and they can save themselves this headache. ""Because I'm about to make it a headache.""The decision to post that video ""wasn't at all planned"", she later told the BBC. ""It was more of a desperate cry to be free.""Polydor's public response was sympathetic. A spokeswoman said the company was ""saddened"" and had contacted Raye's manager (actually her dad, Paul) to ""offer our full support"".Behind closed doors, they told Raye to stop giving interviews.Eventually, however, they came to an agreement. Raye was freed from her contract, and allowed to keep the songs she'd written. Among them was Escapism, a dark and torrid song, written in the depths of her despair as she self-medicated with drugs and meaningless sex.Polydor had never liked it. When Raye played it to other labels, they agreed.""People were like, 'Yeah, this is cool [but] it's just something Raye needs to get out of her system',"" she told me last year. Raye disagreed and released it independently. The song immediately went viral on TikTok and, tens of millions of streams later, it went to number one.The singer followed it up with her long-awaited album, My 21st Century Blues. Gritty, triumphant and catchy, it showcased her ability to genre-hop between jazz, soul, hip-hop, dance and gospel without losing her sense of identity. By the end of the year, it had sold more than 60,000 copies and been nominated for a Mercury Prize. Ahead of the Brits, she's already been honoured with the ceremony's coveted songwriter of the year award.""It's just brilliant when you get to prove people wrong,"" she has said of her success. ""It's not been the simplest story - but it just shows that you should back yourself, no matter what people tell you.""So how did she get here? Let's go back to January 2017, when Raye was a newcomer who'd placed third on the BBC's Sound Of 2017.Then aged 19, she showed us around the childhood bedroom in South London where she'd started making music.""Keep out!"" demanded a handwritten sign on the door. ""I'm doing private stuff! If it's urgent, then knock!""This video can not be playedThe Sound of 2017: RayeDirectly underneath she'd blu-tacked a photo of her little sister, Abby - exposing the tender heart beneath the tough exterior.Inside, it was a typical teenage room - a poster of Gustav Klimt's The Kiss adorned the wall above her bed, while a cluttered desk was crammed full of make-up brushes, school photos and a half-spent candle.""This is my favourite place to be,"" she said. ""Things are starting to happen, but this is still my base. It's nice having my family close.""Music and religion were woven into her home life. Her Yorkshire-born father led worship at the local Pentecostal church while her mother, a Swiss-Ghanaian mental health worker, sang in the choir.After the Sunday services ended, Raye's father would show her how to play worship songs on his piano.""I'd on sit his lap and push his hands out of the way, like, 'I can do it!'"" Aged seven, she repurposed a melody from a kids' TV show and passed it off as her own, a sort-of plagiaristic first venture into writing.Four years later, she penned a ""proper"" song for her Year 6 leaving concert, which the whole school performed at Southwark Cathedral. At 14, she passed an audition for the Brit School, where she spent two years learning the basics of writing and producing. But, ultimately, it wasn't the right fit.""It's all cool, underground, indie artists,"" she said in 2016. ""I did a song called HotBox, and I was scared to play it to people because I was like, 'Oh, my friends might think this is moist [embarrassing].'""A smoky, blurry R&B track about her first encounter with drugs, HotBox was inspired by progressive R&B artists like Jhene Aiko and Frank Ocean. And despite Raye's apprehensions, it was pivotal to her career: The song was discovered by Olly Alexander from Years & Years, who played it to his record label, Polydor. A courtship began.""I had my first album pretty much ready to go before I'd even joined the label,"" Raye subsequently told Vogue. ""By the time I was 17, they had spent three years wooing me... over fancy dinners. ""But it didn't take long for me to see that the dreams they lured me with were hot air.""After the deal was signed, fans who'd fallen in love with Hotbox and Raye's independently-released EP, Welcome To Winter, noticed her music had taken a significant tilt towards pop.At first, she defended the change: ""With Welcome to the Winter, I realised nobody really cared other than the cool kids in London,"" she explained in 2016. ""So I had to find a way to do what I want, in a way that people would hear it.""Before long, she was scoring massive hits on the dance chart. Her first big payout came for co-writing Blonde's All Cried Out. Then, in 2017, she made the top 10 as the guest vocalist and co-writer on Jax Jones's bold and ballsy club anthem You Don't Know Me.The success came with a caveat: Polydor wanted more and more dance hits. Only when Raye had established her name, they insisted, could she take creative control.But that never happened, and the songs she was pressured to write meant almost nothing to her.Speaking to Louis Theroux last year, she singled out the global smash hit Bed (written with David Guetta in 2021), as one of her most soulless recordings.""It's really, really very boring,"" she admitted. ""It's not my favourite song, but my bank account loved that song.""'So what?', you might think. If you can make a living from churning out identikit dance anthems, where's the harm?The truth is that Raye's spirit was being demolished, one generic kick drum at a time. To get through it, she turned to drink, then drugs. ""I was able to get along with my career because I was in some form of sedation,"" she told Theroux.Then it got worse.Raye has always been open about her experiences of sexual assault in the music industry. Her song Ice Cream Man was based on an incident where a music producer forced his hand between her legs when she was 17 years old.Shockingly, it was not an isolated incident. ""This happens to girls in studios all the time,"" she said. ""All the time.""By the time Ice Cream Man was released on her debut album, the updated lyrics listed a catalogue of abuse. ""I was seven, was 21, was 17, and was 11,"" she sang. ""If I was ruthless, they'd be in the penitentiary.""Those memories resurfaced at the same time as a bad break-up and, with her career in tailspin, things got dark.""When you keep things in like that, they eat away at you from the inside,"" she said.""And for me, sadly, substance abuse was entangled with numbing the trauma that I had experienced. I got pretty deep in and it got really dangerous at one point.""Escapism describes the moment she hit rock bottom, snorting cocaine in taxis with strangers and hoping one-night-stands would make the bad thoughts go away.It was only when she reconnected with the church that she pulled herself out of the abyss.""There's a world in which if I didn't find faith again, I might not even be here,"" the singer said.""And when I got sober, I realised what I'd been doing to myself... to try and be somebody they wanted me to be.""That, more than anything else, prompted the dramatic protest against Polydor that kick-started her journey to independence.Doors that had been closed suddenly opened up. She played Glastonbury's Pyramid Stage, won an Ivor Novello award for Escapism, and wrapped up her tour with a massive, televised gig at the Royal Albert Hall.Her record-shattering nominations and wins mark the overdue arrival of a pop star whose voice is as unique as it is compelling.""Finally, I'm here and finally, I'm in control of my career,"" she told me. ""Things are so positive and I really am so grateful. ""But you know it, Mark. It's been a bloody minute.""Can Raye break the Brit Awards record?Raye says her drug use 'got really dangerous'Singer Raye breaks Brit Awards nominations recordHow updating Dolly Parton helped Raye find her voiceRaye calls out music industry greed at Ivor Awards Trail cameras at Vicar Water Country Park in Clipstone were put up in January.Councillor Emma Oldham said they were a good example of the theme of World Wildlife Day on Sunday, which is ""connecting people and planet by exploring digital innovation"". She said the photos have captured ""foxes soaked in the sunshine"". As well as ""magpies flying up into the air in perfect symmetry"", she added. Ms Oldham, who is the portfolio holder for biodiversity and environmental services at Newark and Sherwood District Council, added: ""These trail cameras have helped us get an understanding of the wildlife that are using the site. ""Whilst our rangers can look for evidence of wildlife, some animals are much more illusive and very good at keeping hidden.""It has been able to show us wildlife using the site that we didn't know was there, which is really exciting.""She said cameras have recorded the Eurasian Woodcock at Vicar Water for the first time.She added: ""It means all the conservation project and management work that is going on is enhancing the site for that bird. ""It is really important because that species is listed on the red list of conservation concern. Anything we can do to attract that species here and help support it is wonderful.""Councillor Paul Taylor, portfolio holder for public protection and community relations, said the cameras, which were funded as part of the Nottinghamshire Office of the Police and Crime Commissioner Locality Funding, have also been put up to prevent crime. He said if people can ""see the value of everything in the area, the natural wildlife, hopefully that will prevent them from going on to cause anti-social behaviour"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

She said, if young people and children ""can feel like they can do something to benefit wildlife"", it could have a ""positive effect on them"".The charity has outlined 10 suggested activities for participants to try. Ms Penhallurick said there were a number of ways to create ""wildlife corridors"" by making sure there were ""holes open for small mammals to get through"" or ""places for bird nesting"" on school grounds. She said: ""One of the most important things for wildlife is water sources, but a pond is not always appropriate in a school garden.""This is an exciting opportunity for pupils to engage with the environment around them and to know that they can play an important role in helping Manx wildlife for the future.”Ms Penhallurick said she had already been ""impressed"" by how much schools were doing to try and make their school grounds wildlife friendly, and ""wanted them to be recognised for that"".The trust said feedback from the inaugural awards would be used to shape any repeat of the programme.Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook, external, and X, external?

""I deeply regret it hasn't happened but maybe this is an opportunity to actually get that new provision in the town.""The ICB said: ""The proposals set out a clear commitment to make sure services at St Peter's Hospital such as blood testing and a majority of out patient appointments, stay local.

""We certainly understand and empathise with her mother's pain and frustration.""Mr Bane called 911 immediately upon waking and finding Sarm was not on board. ""He took his dinghy to shore to meet with Virgin Islands Police Department that night and called the US Coast Guard (USCG) the next day when no-one appeared at his boat.

All we've gone through and suddenly there was this massive void,"" said the former South Yorkshire miner. ""I didn't know what I was going do.""Mr Keating, now 76, had spent a year on the frontline of one of the longest and most acrimonious industrial disputes in the country's history. He was among the first men to walk out on strike in March 1984 after learning of the government's plans to shut Cortonwood colliery, near Rotherham, and 19 other pits - some within weeks.More than 140,000 other miners across Britain soon joined them in downing tools. Many went unpaid for 12 months as the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), led by Arthur Scargill, fought to stop a colliery closure programme backed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.During that year, families struggled to afford food, clothe their children and heat their homes. They relied on community donations to survive, with miners' wives running soup kitchens, collecting money and food, and rallying support.""There was a lot of heartache,"" said ex-miner Terry Cadwallander, whose brother took his own life while on strike. ""But we still had to keep going.""For those involved, memories of the strike - and the pit closures which followed the union's defeat - remain raw 40 years on.In new interviews with the BBC, former miners, family members, police, journalists and politicians tell the story of the battle which changed Britain and its coalfield communities forever.Warning: contains strong languageIn March 1984, the National Coal Board (NCB) announced plans to shut 20 pits - which it said were unprofitable - with the loss of at least 20,000 jobs. Workers at Cortonwood colliery in Brampton Bierlow - earmarked to close within weeks - walked out on strike, followed by miners across Yorkshire and other parts of England, Scotland and Wales.As the strike stretched from weeks into months, mining families counted the cost of going unpaid.Miners' families relied on donations from their communities to survive. Wives ran soup kitchens, collected food and money, and held rallies to drum up support.The NUM sent protesters - known as flying pickets - to disrupt and pressure working miners. While most picket lines were relatively peaceful,violence flared between striking miners and police as tensions grew. Officers were drafted in from across the country in a coordinated national policing operation.In June 1984, thousands of miners from across Britain picketed at Orgreave coking plant in South Yorkshire in a bid to stop lorries delivering coal and collecting coke for Scunthorpe power plant. On 18 June, tensions reached boiling point. Police in riot gear on mounted horses charged at miners, leading to violent clashes. Ninety-five people were arrested and charged with riot and violent disorder. All were later cleared.Arthur Scargill vetoed a national ballot on the strike, allowing regional NUM votes instead. In Nottinghamshire, parts of Derbyshire and North Wales, miners voted against joining the walkout and many carried on working. They were known as ""scabs"" by striking miners, who picketed as they arrived at work. Peter Short, a union official, was among those who worked.After a year on strike, a growing number of miners were choosing to return to work. On 3 March,1984, NUM leaders voted to end the dispute without an agreement with the NCB and instructed members to go back to work.By the end of 1985, 23 pits including Cortonwood had shut. Ninety-seven further closures followed before the coal industry was privatised in 1994. The UK's last deep coal mine shut in 2015.Follow BBC Yorkshire on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter) and Instagram.

From April, the government has promised working parents of two-year-olds in England 15 hours of free care a week.Labour said the commitment was ""in tatters"", describing it as a ""botched pledge without a plan"". Under proposals announced in last year's Budget, the government is rolling out the expansion of free childcare in stages. Working parents of three and four-year-olds are already able to get 30 hours of free childcare. From September, it will be extended to 15 hours for those aged nine months and above. Then from September 2025, the government has pledged to offer 30 hours of free childcare for all under-fives. However, nurseries and other early years providers have warned they will struggle to meet the expected demand for the scheme. The sector argues that years of underfunding has led to a recruitment and retention crisis, meaning there are not enough staff to deliver the policy. Nurseries have also complained of delays in confirming how much they will be paid to offer free hours. Meanwhile, some parents have reported challenges finding local nurseries offering free hours which have places available. Asked if he could give a guarantee to parents and childcare providers that all the places needed to deliver the pledge would be ready for April, Mr Hunt said the policy amounted to ""the biggest expansion of childcare in a generation"". ""It may mean that we need to employ 40,000 more people in the sector and that's why we're bringing it in stages,"" he told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme. ""You'll understand why I don't want to give an absolute guarantee. But am I confident we are delivering this programme and it will be on track for this April? Yes, I am.""Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson accused Mr Hunt of ""rushing out"" the commitment ""with no plan to make it happen"". ""Now it's working parents, who in the weeks and months ahead - when they go and try and access those places that have been promised - will discover that they just can't be delivered in the way that he set out,"" she told the programme. She has written to the chancellor to demand the free childcare pledge will be delivered as scheduled and without parents facing extra charges. Asked what provision Labour would guarantee if it wins power, Ms Phillipson said: ""I'm not going to make the same mistakes the Conservatives have made - rushing something out without a plan to make it happen.""She added her party had commissioned a review of early years by the former chief inspector of Ofsted, Sir David Bell, which she said would look at how to drive up standards and ensure childcare places were available. Purnima Tanuku, chief executive of the National Day Nurseries Association, said the chancellor needed to address ""the huge challenges facing early years providers"", including by offering sustainable funding rates and removing business rates.""This is the only way that nurseries can plan for a sustainable future and be able to deliver the increased childcare offer being made to parents,"" she said.Free childcare: Keegan confident of April startCash offer for new childcare workers amid shortageFamilies won't miss out on childcare - ministerWho gets 15 hours of free childcare and when do I apply? Police Scotland said officers were called to the attraction in Glasgow's west end at about 11:55 on Sunday.Two women, aged 23 and 30, were charged following the incident, which involved a Queen Victoria bust.A spokesperson said the women were released on an undertaking to appear at Glasgow Sheriff Court at a later date.Climate activist group, This is Rigged, said protesters staged a demonstration to raise awareness about rising food insecurity in the UK.

The Free Soul team also told us their product ""includes clinically studied and patented ingredients"".Rheal Superfoods, which was also contacted by the BBC, does not make any scientific claims in its online marketing.These products have also been approved to be sold in the UK by the Food Standards Association, the regulator which monitors food safety.Miss Hill says analysing these three products in particular: ""If we look at the research, these claims aren't backed up by scientific evidence and the evidence that we do have is very poor quality.""She adds: ""It has very few people in the studies and lots of them are only in a petri dish, so fairly unreliable."" Miss Hill says she feels that these products, which count as ultra-processed because they have a complicated manufacturing process, ""are playing on our health anxieties"".She says from her experience as a dietitian that ""younger generations are becoming increasingly health-conscious"" but is concerned ""people are being misled into spending money for a perceived health benefit that's not really there"".Registered nutritionist and author Jenna Hope says she thought super green products initially had a niche appeal, but says the huge number of products available on the market ""suggests that people are buying them"".One industry estimate suggests the green powder market will double from £220m in 2023 to nearly £395m by 2030.""There's lots of misleading information - these brands make you think you need these products to be healthy and support your cognitive function, your gut health, energy and sleep,"" Ms Hope tells the BBC.""But actually we know that if you focus on having a healthy and balanced diet, you can get those benefits as well and don't need to consume these elite green powders,"" she adds.Super green powder supplements vary in price, but cost about £1 to £4 per day depending on which one you choose.""For some people that can be the weekly budget of a food shop,"" Ms Hope says.""So if we instead focus on consuming lots of fruits and vegetables, even things like frozen spinach, greens, beans and pulses like lentils and whole grains, that's really affordable,"" she adds.Ms Hope emphasises that even reducing your intake of refined sugars, artificial sweeteners and ultra-processed foods will have a really positive effect on your health.Miss Hill says that while these supplements may not have the science behind them to back up their claims, ""they're not harmful, so people can try them if they want to"".There is also another aspect that Ms Hope considers, that ""for some people, they can put you in a healthy mindset"".""So if you start your day with these greens, you may feel more confident to make healthier choices later on in the day, even if they don't necessarily make you healthier,"" she adds.Ms Hope also considers that for people who are perhaps time-poor, there might be a benefit.""There really isn't a one size fits all - if you take an individual with a highly stressful job, this could help them get closer to an adequate amount of nutrients,"" she adds.She says they can also help people with dietary restrictions that prevent them from consuming some types of fruit and vegetables.Nichola Ludlam-Raine, who represents the British Dietetic Association, tells the BBC ""whole foods should always be the first choice for nutrition"".""Green supplements are certainly not necessary for health or a healthy diet, and in addition they do not count towards your five-a-day,"" she adds.She recommends that people should focus on eating 30 different plant-based foods a week, such as whole grains, to increase fibre intake and adds that anyone who wants to take a green supplement should first consult a dietitian or registered nutritionist.Plant-based diets good for the heartBigger breakfasts better for controlling appetiteVegetables alone not enough to reduce heart riskLiquid diets: Do they work and are they safe? RNLI heritage manager David Weldon said he was ""blown away"" by the display, organised to coincide with the charity's 200th anniversary.Sir William Hillary was living in Douglas and witnessed numerous shipwrecks around the coast when he petitioned for the institution.Sir William founded the RNLI in 1824.All At Sea, at the House of Manannan in Peel, was officially opened by the island's lieutenant governor ahead of the anniversary on 4 March.The project, which was a collaboration between the charity and Manx National Heritage (MHH), features some ""very special"" objects, including the gold medal given to Sir William by the institution for founding it.MNH curator Allison Fox said that was a significant feature because ""we know that it was around the coast of the Isle of Man that the idea was formed"".She added: ""He writes in Douglas in February 1823 that the idea of this national institution 'has only suggested itself to me since my residence on a part of the coast often exposed to the most distressing scenes of misery'.""To have this illustration of that point in history, when this fantastic thing started, is great to have.""The medal has been loaned to MNH by the RNLI, but the exhibition also contains items relating to the formation from the Manx National Collections.They include original pamphlets outlining what it should be founded on, including the earliest in which Sir William sets out why an organisation was needed, and what it should be.""This particular one is a first edition and it's just got 'from the author' written on it, which is a nice touch,"" Ms Fox said.Reflecting on the mixture of the island's role as the birthplace of the lifesaving institution and broader Manx maritime heritage, Mr Weldon said the balance of ""tales of endeavour and shipwreck"" together with its place in the RNLI's history was ""just right"".Why not follow BBC Isle of Man on Facebook and X?

""We're hoping to produce more colours in the future.""The dyes are based on a fluorescent protein found in jellyfish, called Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP), which is used extensively by research scientists to visualise biological processes. This means the dyes are biologically compatible and don't interfere with subsequent DNA analysis of the fingerprints.The fine spray prevents splashes that could damage prints, is less messy than a powder and works quickly even on rough surfaces where it is harder to capture fingerprints, such as brick.Dr Luling Wu, also from the University of Bath (UK), said: ""The probes are only weakly fluorescent in aqueous solution, but emit strong fluorescence once they bind to the fingerprints through the interaction between the probes and fatty acids or amino acids.""The team is working in collaboration with scientists from Shanghai Normal University, China. Principal investigator, Professor Chusen Huang, said: ""We hope this technology can really improve the detection of evidence at crime scenes.""We are now collaborating with some companies to make our dyes available for sale.

Her daughter is a pupil at Ballycraigy Primary and she said she had been relieved by the warm welcome. “Coming to this country was not easy for us,"" she explained. ""We don’t know anyone here and we don’t have any family or anything. ""So for Ballycraigy Primary School to have an inclusion week and for them to make us feel like we are part of the family that is very, very important. And I do not take that for granted.”Nosipho said she had never encountered any issues around her race in Ballycraigy. ""Everyone is embracing us. I am happy here now,"" she said.Nosipho Muzvidziwa moved to Northern Ireland from South Africa  Among the delicacies on offer at the food tasting were Chinese soups, Indian daal and fruits from South America. One of the pupils, Kwabena, also known as KO, brought in some noodles which are popular in Ghanian culture.“My friends absolutely loved the noodles; they’d never tried them before but they were a bit spicy,"" he said.His friend Addison said she had yet to try them, but added ""I think that they are amazing”. Jordan Bone, from King's Lynn, Norfolk, was just 15 when she became a quadriplegic in the accident.After battling depression, her beauty videos attracted millions of views on YouTube, but singing had always been her passion.""It feels incredible to have a song out there in the world,"" she said.Ms Bone was a passenger in a car that rolled into a ditch in 2005.""When I became conscious I was lying against the roof with the seatbelt wrapped around my neck,"" she said.""I thought I was going to die. I remember thinking, 'I am 15 years old, I've got so much to do'.""I began singing Candi Staton's You've Got the Love - and it was probably just a whisper - but it brought me back to the moment. It felt like singing saved me.""Ms Bone said she realised in that moment that she was paralysed, but she assumed that after spinal surgery life would be ""exactly the same, but in a wheelchair"".""I didn't realise all the support I would need,"" she said.""At that time I was starting to get more independence; to have that taken away felt like starting from scratch. ""After a couple of years it really hit me, I became down and I felt quite isolated and excluded - especially as a teenager, as if being a teenager isn't hard enough.""In time, guided meditations helped her, and she began to post her own positivity videos about beauty and living with a disability.""You didn't see many people with disability in the beauty world, and I wanted to be one of those people to help make those changes,"" she said.Ms Bone has always loved singing and songwriting, and she has now teamed up with musician Jim Kakes to release ""dream pop"" tune Solid Ground.""The song is about love, trust and the twists and turns that come with it, the desire and insecurities from past situations and expecting something unhealthy when, surprisingly, it is grounded and safe,"" she said.""You start from you own ideas and you are making something that everyone can now listen to, so that part of the process feels quite magical, and it feels so special to me.""I want to keep the momentum going; I am really proud of it and I want to become a stronger songwriter.""Follow East of England news on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter.

""British farming is at the heart of British trade and we put agriculture at the forefront of any deals we negotiate, prioritising new export opportunities, protecting UK food standards and removing market access barriers.“We’ve maintained the £2.4 billion annual farming budget which supports farmers to produce food profitably and sustainably and are also looking at ways to further improve fairness in the supply chain and support British farmers and growers, as well as ensuring customers have access to high-quality fresh British products.”The Canterbury protest follows a tractor go-slow demonstration at the port of DoverAndrew Opie, director of food and sustainability at British Retail Consortium, said: “Food retailers source, and will continue to source, the vast majority of their food from the UK and know they need to pay a sustainable price to farmers.""Given the pressure on British farmers at the moment, retailers are paying more for their produce.

""I understand that incidents of this nature can be alarming, but I would like to reassure the local community that this was an isolated incident and there is no wider risk to the public.""He said there would be a higher police presence in the area in the coming days as officers investigated.

Send your story ideas to: newsonline.westmidlands@bbc.co.ukWest Mercia Police Laing, 35, who is replacing long-standing presenter Jordan North, will host his first show on Monday.When Laing was unveiled as the new host, some social media users complained he was too posh.But Laing told The Sunday Times it was wrong to assume he ""just swanned in"".""I've been trying to get this job for eight years, constantly grinding, constantly asking to do little slots,"" he said.""No-one is given a job here because their mum or dad helped them into it. You have to earn your colours."" Radio 1 announced last month that Laing would be taking over the Going Home show between 15:30-17:45 Monday to Thursdays alongside Vick Hope.He had previously presented on the station during Mollie King's maternity leave, describing it as ""an absolute dream"".But some fans of the station expressed their dissatisfaction at the decision, with one writing on Twitter/X: ""Radio 1 has turned into the posh boys club.""North, who spent time at a community radio station while still at university, worked his way up in the industry.Laing, whose great-grandfather founded the McVitie's biscuit empire, was privately educated. He is best known for appearing on the reality television series Made in Chelsea, which follows the lives of affluent young people in West London.Addressing the criticism directly, Laing indicated he saw his new role as vindication.""I suppose what people see now is that I'm maybe not just a posh idiot,"" he said.""After years of doing podcasting, the audience went, 'Oh, hang on, we trust this person'. That's what it's all about, especially in audio, because you don't really see the individual, so you really need to trust them.""Laing also laughed at some of the abuse he has received online.""Someone commented, 'I think Jamie Laing's a really great guy', and someone wrote underneath saying, 'What planet are you on? Is there oxygen?' That's actually quite funny,"" he said.Laing previously co-hosted the Radio 1 podcast 6 Degrees from Jamie and Spencer and also presents the NewlyWeds podcast alongside his wife Sophie Habboo, another Made in Chelsea star.North is to replace Roman Kemp as host of Capital Radio's breakfast show.He had presented the drivetime show with Hope since 2021, having previously presented weekend shows like Greatest Hits on Sundays.He also co-hosts the popular Help I Sexted My Boss podcast with William Hanson.In 2020, he took part in I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!, finishing second.Jordan North to replace Roman Kemp as Capital hostJordan North speaks out after sudden Radio 1 exit Thomas Wong was riding his bike when he was involved in a collision with the vehicle on Whitehouse Road, at about 08:20 on Friday. Police Scotland said he was pronounced dead at the scene. In a statement, released by the force on Sunday, Thomas' family said they were ""utterly heartbroken"".It continued: ""Thomas was the perfect son. He was the best little brother to his older sister and was adored by all his family.""Thomas went to Cramond Primary School which he loved. He made good friends there. We will all miss him terribly.""The family, who live in Edinburgh, added they were very grateful for all the sympathy and heartfelt messages they had received.On Friday, Helen Donaldson, head teacher of Cramond Primary School, said Thomas was ""always smiling"" and that he was a ""positive, friendly and curious"" boy.She said: ""We are utterly devastated by the tragic news of the sudden death of one our pupils. Our thoughts are with his family and friends during this incredibly difficult time.""He was kind and always eager to support others, and will be greatly missed by all of us.""Insp Andrew Thomson said: ""Our thoughts are very much with Thomas's family and friends. Specially trained officers are supporting the family at this time.""We are continuing with our inquiries to establish the full circumstances of the incident and would appeal to anyone who may have information, and has not yet contacted police, is to get in touch with officers.""  Insp Thomson also urged anyone with private CCTV or dash cam footage to get in touch.The bin lorry driver was not injured in the incident, which happened near the junction with Braehead Road.Thomas is the second child to be killed after being hit by a bin lorry in Scotland this year.Last month an 11-year-old girl died in hospital in Edinburgh a week after she was critically injured in the Borders.Elizabeth Bell was struck by a vehicle on the A6105, near East Gordon, on 31 January.Boy, aged 11, dies after being hit by bin lorryContact Police Scotland One video, which has had millions of views, shows the mysterious figure appearing from behind a mirror to whimpering children.But now The Unknown has been unmasked as 16-year-old Felicia, from Glasgow.And she is thrilled her first paid acting job has gone viral.The villain was met with confusion worldwide as The Unknown was noticeably absent from the plot of Roald Dahl's classic children's book, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.Felicia told BBC Scotland News: ""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny.""In the lead up to last month's event the organisers, House of Illuminati, advertised a ""journey filled with wondrous creations"".Willy Wonka was a fictional chocolatier who ran a competition for lucky finders of a golden ticket to visit his factory.But visitors who hoped to relive the classic book and movies - including the 1971 original starring Gene Wilder - were bitterly disappointed when they arrived at a sparsely-decorated warehouse.The event was held last weekend in an industrial estate in Whiteinch, where actors tried to make the best of some sad-looking props and a small bouncy castle.Children were offered a half-cup of lemonade and a small ration of jelly beans on their trip to the imaginary sweet factory.Parents paid up to £35 a ticket but were so appalled they called Police Scotland. Within hours the event was abruptly cancelled, leaving some families unable to get in at all.According to the script, which is said to be the result of artificial intelligence, The Unknown was an evil rival chocolate maker who lives in walls.The story involves his attempt to steal Willy's ""Anti-Graffiti Gobstopper"".Felicia was originally cast in the starring role of Willy McDuff - seemingly inspired by Willy Wonka - before opting for The Unknown.A video of the villain, dressed in a silver mask and black cloak, emerging from behind a mirror to unhappy children took off on social media last week.The teenager said: ""There weren't any rehearsals. I got there early to practise but it hadn't been set up.""The actors came up later and it still hadn't been set up. ""We were all saying it was a mess and there hadn't been any organisation, but we were just hoping that together it wouldn't be that bad. But it was.""The actors were told to improvise on the day, so Felicia waited behind the mirror for each of the three Willy McDuff characters to pass through with their group.She said: ""My character didn't make any sense without the Wonka explaining who I was, that I was The Unknown, an evil chocolate maker who lives in the walls.""So I was just sitting behind the mirror trying to act creepy because that was the only direction I was given.""It was definitely a mixed bag of reactions. Some people loved it, some people were terrified of it. ""But I think most people didn't really know what I was there for - which was the same for me.""Felicia said her concerns about the performance intensified just 45 minutes after the doors opened.She recalled: ""The first few runs were actually working quite well because there was order in it.""But people were straggling in and then it was just all going wrong.""In the room next to the mirror, one of the Wonkas had been in there for like an hour straight and he hadn't left and the other two Wonkas had just disappeared.""During that time more people were coming along and it would build up and build up.""I was sitting behind the mirror texting my mum saying it was going so wrong.""Felicia said each Wonka led a group of about 60 people and often they could not all fit in one room.She added: ""One of the other Wonkas made up a storyline that if the children pulled a silly face at me, I would be scared and hide back in my corner. ""That worked really well and it would kind of make sense with the plot. ""But that didn't happen every time so sometimes I just had to awkwardly walk back to my corner.""Felicia revealed she still has the costume from the event and said it was ""quite funny"" that people had been asking for it.After the experience was shut down, the actors went to the pub for a debrief.She recalled: ""When we came back it was just a big massive mob outside.""There were like four police cars outside. It was really crazy.""But despite the backlash, Felicia said the response had been positive on the whole.She added: ""At first I was really embarrassed about it. But when we went to the pub after, we were just laughing about it.""It was so ridiculous it was actually funny. ""And now it's become viral, it's genuinely life-changing and I'm really happy I did it. ""Everybody loves the character and posting about it, so it makes me happy that people can see the funny side."" Doctor's had described Elijah, from Pontypridd, as a medical ""mystery"" and were unable to explain his constant illness prior his diagnosis.Chloe Jones, Elijah's mum and also a nurse, said he has ""never gone longer than two weeks"" without becoming ill.Elijah is now in need of a bone marrow transplant and his family are urging people to help them find a match.Chloe said she first began to piece together why Elijah had been in and out of hospital for almost 18 months, while giving him a bath. ""I noticed there were quite a few bruises going along his spine… then I noticed his mouth and his tongue and lips had all of these blood spots and they looked like blisters,"" she said. She and her partner Rhys began to consider that low levels of blood platelets - cells which help prevent bleeding - could be affecting Elijah's health.After a 10-day stay in the Noah's Ark Children's Hospital in Cardiff, Elijah was diagnosed with genetic condition Noonan syndrome and juvenile myelomonocytic leukaemia (JMML), a rare type of blood cancer which affects young children.In just 12 weeks, Elijah had developed tonsillitis, croup, respiratory syncytial virus, pneumonia, and an ear infection.""If he just had a common cold it would lead to something else, it would be sickness, he would be off his food... and then it would be something else - it was just constant,"" said Chloe.Chemotherapy is not as effective for treating Elijah's condition, as JMML is not an active cancer, lying  dormant until patients become unwell.Elijah requires a bone marrow transplant, where healthy stem cells are implanted into the patient via their bloodstream, where they begin to grow and create healthy cells.His family are now appealing for people to sign up to the stem cell register, in order to give Elijah the best chance of finding a donor match.Elijah's appeal has received the support of blood cancer charity Anthony Nolan, as well as a number of celebrities and sports stars.  A social media post from Chloe to update friends and family about her son's progress was shared by far and wide, including by former Tottenham and West Ham manager Harry Redknapp.Chloe said she and Rhys had been trying to keep Elijah's life as normal as possible, by doing a lot of outdoor activities such as walks and trips to the park, but his life has become limited.""We've taken him out of childcare, to just try and eliminate any risk of him getting any kind of illness at childcare, soft plays, anywhere like that is a 'no go' zone,"" she said. Speaking ahead of his second birthday celebrations, Chloe said it had been ""really hard"" to make any plans. ""I can't guarantee what the weather is going to be like, I can't plan anything, so no plans yet. Hopefully we can just go for a walk or to the park. As much as I love Wales it is quite tough.""Despite his health troubles, Chloe says Elijah hasn't let his condition slow him down, and that ""you wouldn't think anything was wrong if you saw him"".""Even when he was really unwell and he was in hospital he was still running up and down the corridors, going into the other children's rooms, pinching chocolates and snacks... he is definitely a little soldier."" Chloe said it had been helpful to finally have some answers for Elijah's health problems, and to have the support of parents of other children her son had been in hospital with. In an appeal for people to add their name to the stem cell register, she said: ""You don't know how much it's needed until you see it first hand and it's such a simple thing to do to donate your bone marrow.""It's absolutely life changing for those who need it and there are so many people who do need it, and there's not enough people on the register.""It's so simple to get on the register, if you're already donating blood or platelets, it's just a tick box, and if you're not, it's just a mouth swab. It's so simple, and if you get called up you're potentially saving a life.""Family struggles with cost of cancer treatment'My stress of rising costs and a child with cancer'Million pound appeal for girl with leukaemia This video can not be playedPeople living with one of the most common types of alopecia could soon have access to treatment on the NHS in Scotland for the first time.The drug - called Ritlecitinib - will go before the Scottish Medicines Consortium this week after it was approved for NHS use in England last month.Although the daily pill won’t cure the condition, it could provide treatment to some who have severe alopecia areata, like 21-year-old Megan McCready, from Clydebank.Since her diagnosis at the age of 12, Megan has learned to embrace her condition and now supports other young people going through the same thing.Video by Morgan Spence and Hazel Martin'I embrace my alopecia, but I’d love my old hair back’ Video, 00:01:39'I embrace my alopecia, but I’d love my old hair back’Up Next.

Video, 00:01:00Scores of cars on fire in junkyard blaze Here, Nadiya reflects on how her childhood shaped her - ending with the words she composed for her 13-year-old. From the moment she was born, I realised I was not prepared to bring a daughter into this world who would ever think that she was less than anyone else.She is my youngest child. I have two sons as well - they are 16 and 17.I knew growing up as brown Muslim boys would be hard for them both - but they have not had to deal with the hurdles and challenges facing my daughter. There is an affirmation that I've taught them all - but especially her: ""Elbows out."" You need to make space for yourself wherever you go.Now she is a teenager, I don't want my daughter to lose the big dreams and bold ambitions that I lost as a girl.At school, in Luton in the early 1990s, I remember learning about world leaders in history. ""That's what I want to be,"" I thought. ""I'm going to become prime minister."" But then somebody would say: ""Well, have you ever seen a brown prime minister?"" And that particular dream would be squashed.It makes you think how far we have come today.As I approached the age my daughter is now, Nadiya the dreamer was disappearing. I could see that the path ahead of me was to be different to that of my brothers. There was a hierarchy in my family - and men were always at the top. My brothers had freedom, they could socialise, and they could get an education. Although I worked hard in my A-levels and wanted to go to university, my mum told me there was absolutely no way.""You're a girl, you need to get married,"" she said. I felt as though the person who once had been so lively was disappearing. But now, when I look back, I am proud of who I have become. I think my children are too.Dear Daughter: Elbows out with Nadiya HussainListen on BBC SoundsWhen I was a little girl, I never saw anyone like me on a TV cookery show. OK, I might not be prime minister, but thanks to my passion for baking, I have become a British Bangladeshi in the public eye. Baking built my confidence and helped me cope with my anxiety - I have PTSD and panic disorder. It helped me make connections with people, through the sharing of food.Maybe the big dreams of Nadiya, the little girl, weren't so unrealistic after all.Both my daughter and eldest son love baking. My second son does the dishes. My husband on the other hand is a terrible cook. Once, as he was boiling eggs, they exploded and hit the ceiling.My daughter is very smart, conscientious and kind. She rolls her eyes sometimes when I give her advice - but I know she is really listening deep down.When I sent this letter to my daughter on her phone, she asked if we could frame it and put it in her room. ""Absolutely, we'll frame it,"" I said. I never want to lose our lines of communication.This is your Ma, though when I speak, I know you do not listen. Not really. You shrug. You dismiss, you reel in disgust, as I suggest that I may know better. You look at me and all you see is your mother. The Woman, the person you have known your whole life.You see what is stood in front of you, though often bedraggled. I am here. I am your mother. That is all you see. Not the person that came before her. Let me tell you a little bit about that little girl.That girl, well, she was nothing like your mother. This girl, she was wild. She had great thoughts and even greater dreams. She wasn't afraid to speak her mind. She spoke about how she felt. She spoke about change. She preached about fairness. Even at her tender age. She knew where she wanted to be. Despite the blockades that life had in store for her.Sometimes I daydream and wonder where that little girl went. How did she disappear out of plain sight so fast? Then I look at you and realise you are that little girl. Same, but entirely different. Fierce, bold and bright, like your mother before you.This is your Ma. Though even when I speak, I know you do not listen. Just know that the little girl inside me that I once was, and I once lost, is holding your hand. And we won't lose another little girl ever again. Let your fire always be fierce. May your purpose guide you. Be the brightest shining light.Baking the Queen's birthday cake More than 4,500 people work at Asos's distribution centre in Grimethorpe - more than that who live in the former south Wales mining village of Maerdy.How well they've responded to losing their mine, the old village heartbeat, depends on your barometer of success.Is getting bigger better, or is it all about a tight-knit community spirit?A quarter of the Welsh population live in former coalfield communities and near the head of the Rhondda Valley in Maerdy, there's a few shops, takeaways, a pub and one road in and one road out. On a busy day, it can take almost two-and-a-half hours on public transport to get the nearest big city, so locals say people have to move away from their community to get work.Roads, railway lines and more importantly industry - or jobs  - never arrived after the pit shut in 1990, five years after miners went back to work following the miners' strike.""Lots of things were promised, but not a lot of things came to the valley,"" said Dawn Wood, who was deputy head at Maerdy Primary for 45 years, including during the strike.""That is a condemnation of any government, whether it's Labour, Conservative, every government. I cannot blame one more than the other.""Coal has been at the heart of everything in Maerdy for more than 100 years - livelihoods, the social and sporting scene. The mine was the community.When miners marched back to work at the local mine in 1985 after the strike, it was the beginning of the end for coal mining in the village.The town walked in lockstep with the miners, accompanied by a brass band, but within five years the pit was gone for good - and Dawn, now in her 60s, reckons the village's fortunes have steadily declined.""It is the lack of foresight, they promise things but they don't put it in,"" said Dawn.""So as far as I'm concerned it is not the people that have let the valleys down, it is governments that have let the valleys down.""Dawn isn't alone as a new BBC survey suggests three in five people said closing the pits had a negative impact on their area - and almost three-quarters polled said they'd seen little or no regeneration.""Shops have closed, everybody had to go out of the valley to work... It's all gone, it's not the same,"" said lifelong Maerdy resident Phil Pugh.There is also more deprivation, higher unemployment and poorer health, and new research estimates nearly 20% of people are out of work in the village deep in the Rhondda Fach Valley.""We haven't got a train, they promised a new road that was supposed to come all the way up to Maerdy, but it only came up as far as Pontygwaith,"" said Gill Owen and Trina Coombs, who join the Knit and Natter group in Maerdy every Tuesday. ""You've got one road in and one road out. Big businesses will not come up here, because of the cost of their travelling time. If there's an accident, you can't get out. ""Last year the workmens' club in Tylorstown got burnt down. We were stuck for four days.""While the last four decades haven't been kind to Maerdy, some former coalfield communities have flourished.Miners in the Yorkshire village Grimethorpe in south Yorkshire marched back to work around the same time as those in Maerdy, also accompanied by their own brass band made famous by the Ewan McGregor film Brassed Off.Grimethorpe's pit shut in 1993 - and within a year the village near Barnsley was considered the poorest in the UK with half the workforce unemployed.""Let's be blunt, the government walked away - it devastated that community and said goodbye... and in a sense everything just imploded,"" said Sir Stephen Houghton, head of the multi-agency Grimethorpe Regeneration Board.This video can not be playedThe story of the miners' strikes in Wales in 1984 and 1985""This wasn't miners losing a few jobs, they lost a whole way of life. Everything disappeared overnight. Society in the village started to break down. Crime and disorder went through the roof.""But a £100m injection built new roads, attracted industry including international fashion retailer Asos, and Grimethorpe - about halfway between Leeds and Sheffield - has grown.""We had to show the people of Grimethorpe, that somebody cared about them and would work with them, and try and find funds, to try and turn the thing around,"" added Sir Stephen, now Barnsley council leader.Grimethorpe grew - the fortunes of the village and those who lived there changed - but not everyone benefited.""The new road opened up a lot of possibilities,"" said internationally-renowned dance artist Gary Clarke, who is was born and bred in Grimethorpe.""It's also brought a lot of new people into the village. I don't want to paint a picture like it's all a bed of roses. It's definitely not. The scars still run very deep in Grimethorpe. ""You can see the division between the old community and some of the newer people that come into the village. What brings people together in Grimethorpe is the legacy of the place.""A lot of the newer people don't necessarily know the history that Grimethorpe is built on and so with that I think they don't have that community spirit. The soul of Grimethorpe's changed dramatically, but we are trying our best to bring those two sides together.""It's the opposite back in Maerdy. While some may think they have nothing, others feel having each other is everything - a community spirit that many villages yearn for.""Open your door, and there's always somebody who'd do you a favour"", says Karen Knott, enjoying a weekly catch-up at Knit and Natter.""If you were ill, they'd post you a letter, get you a pint of milk - they'd still do it now. My husband was putting an old bike in the car the other day, and somebody came along and asked if he needed any help.""The current head at the local school likens the current cost of living crisis to the strike in the 80s - and she feels it was community that got people through then, and it will be community that will get people through now.""During the strike people stood together and helped each other,"" said Maerdy primary head Helen Gregory.""Today with the financial climate that we're in, people need help as they did back then and we still have people standing side by side helping each other.""If you go out and about in Maerdy people know each other, people care about each other. There are not many jobs in Maerdy - but we're proud to live here.""Welsh miners in Ukraine to repay 1984 strike helpHow did the miners' strike affect Wales?Voices from the 1984 miners' strike They have been organised by the Memory Stones of Love group, which was set up by families wanting to remember their loved ones together.Events are taking place across the UK on Sunday to remember lives lost as part of a national day of reflection.In Londonderry bereaved families took part in a walk across the Peace Bridge.A minute's silence was then held in the city's Peace Flame Garden.Ciaran Ward's parents Bredge and Owen Ward, from Strabane, County Tyrone, died within 12 hours of each other in November 2020.""Today is a special day for all of the bereaved families to come together to grieve together to remember their loved ones,"" Mr Ward told BBC News NI.""For myself, during the pandemic to lose Mum and Dad, it feels surreal, it still doesn't feel real.""Mr Ward recalled being unable to visit his parents in hospital due to the strict measures put in place at the time to reduce transmission of the Covid-19 virus. ""Not being able to see them - everyone in life wants to be with their family as they pass away,"" he said. ""And they also want to be at home. And for us, for Mum and Dad - they were denied that.""He added: ""It's important that as a collective society that we all come together and we remember the horror that has happened and the trauma that has happened for so many people.""Catriona Myles's father Gerry McLarnon was 67 when he died during the pandemic. She recalled how her dad, who suffered from cancer, died without family members present when he was admitted to hospital in December 2020 after contracting Covid.The annual day of reflection is ""so important for the families"", she said.She said she was at Sunday's event ""to bring comfort, compassion and solidarity to other families that have faced the same losses as ourselves"". ""Everyone wants to move on and I understand that as a society we need to move on but, for the families, there are so many questions unanswered,"" she added.""And it's a very lonely place that we're in a lot of the time.""Families also attended events in Belfast and Enniskillen to remember those who died. In Belfast Memory Stones of Love organised a the craft event, from which bereaved family members planned to walk together to Belfast City Hall, which will be lit up yellow in memory of those who died.Last year the group laid more than 300 memory stones in the shape of a heart outside City Hall.The stones were individually painted and bore the name of a loved one who died in the pandemic.Other public buildings across Northern Ireland, including the Guildhall in Derry, will also be illuminated yellow on Sunday evening as a mark of respect. Covid bereaved gather to remember lost loved onesCouple dies 12 hours apart with Covid-19Politicians lack humanity, Covid daughter says ""It was mental,"" said Meg and Charlie, both 29, who live in Swansea. James gifted the couple the tickets for the show, which took place at London's O2 Arena, as an engagement present.The DJ also spent the night itself at the couple's home in Swansea, babysitting their daughter, Maisie, seven - where he got his nails painted.""Maisie absolutely loved it,"" said Meg, who's originally from Pontypridd, joking that James had a ""similar mindset of age"" to their daughter. James appeared to enjoy himself as well, posting a picture of him playing with Maisie's doll house, as well as a video of them together at the park. He also posted a list of chores Maisie had given him, which included washing the dishes with pink gloves, reading time, and salon time.A photo posted later in the night showed James with a set of pink nails. The relationship between the couple and the DJ started when Charlie appeared on a segment of James' show called What's my Age Again, and ""stupidly"" got his own age wrong. It developed from there, with both Charlie and Meg appearing on the show, both individually and together, in the last few months. They appeared again on Friday and were expecting to take part in a ""Mr and Mrs"" style quiz, which Meg said she had researched for. ""But it was a complete ploy - they told us the truth, that they wanted us to swap lives,"" she said. James said he had attended the show before, and wanted to give away his and his wife's tickets. He offered to babysit the couple's daughter, and on Saturday Meg and Charlie travelled to London where they were put up in a hotel. ""The only thing we had to worry about what was finding something to wear,"" Meg said.They said they had an ""amazing time"" at the show, with seats close to the stage, and indulged in a fair amount of celeb-spotting. They were also full of praise for James, describing him as a ""selfless"" and ""genuine person"". Meg is a maternity worker for the NHS, and Charlie a field technician for an advertising company, and the couple joked they had a ""very romantic story"" of meeting online. Meg is originally from Pontypridd and Charlie from Essex, and James has described the couple as ""a real life Gavin and Stacey"". ""To be honest, we're more like Nessa and Smithy,"" said Meg, referring to the characters played by James Corden and Ruth Jones. ""We like KFC too much."" It was a night out the television characters would likely have embraced.""We were back by 2am. We ended the night with a McDonald's - that's our kind of night,"" Meg said. Raye makes history by winning six Brit AwardsWho won what at the Brit Awards - the full listBrit Awards 2024: The real winners and losers Jo Hamilton was falsely accused of stealing £36,000 from a Post Office in South Warnborough, Hampshire. On stage at the ceremony, she called for compensation to be sped up for those wrongfully prosecuted.She was joined by the actress who played her in ITV's Mr Bates vs The Post Office, Monica Dolan.The hit drama has been credited with creating mass public interest in the scandal.Mrs Hamilton, 66, told the crowd at the O2 Arena: ""I want to thank everyone in the country for the love and the support they have given the postmasters. ""Please can you keep on supporting us because, despite what the government says, they're not paying the postmasters.""The mother-of-two was prosecuted for a shortfall of £36,000 in 2006 and was persuaded to plead guilty to a charge of false accounting.She took up a cleaning job, had to mortgage her house twice, borrowed money from friends, and received donations from the local community to pay back the funds.Her conviction was overturned in 2021 when it was discovered more than 700 sub-postmasters and postmistresses were prosecuted because of a faulty accounting system.Mrs Hamilton presented the Song of the Year award to Raye for Escapism, a track which also featured the artist 070 Shake.Raye made history on the night, winning six prizes and beating Blur, Adele and Harry Styles' record four wins at a single ceremony.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Researchers at the University of Surrey taught an artificial intelligence (AI) system to predict the 3D pose from a 2D image of a dog.A myriad of virtual dogs were created using the video game Grand Theft Auto.Postgraduate research student Moira Shooter said: ""From ecology to animation, this neat solution has so many possible uses.""One way to teach AI to get 3D information from 2D images is to show it photos while giving it information about 3D 'ground truth' - where the objects are in 3D space.For humans, that means wearing motion capture suits.  Unable to replicate the same with dogs, researchers altered the code of Grand Theft Auto V, switching the main character for one of eight breeds of dog - a process known as modding.They generated 118 videos of the dogs sitting, walking, barking and running in a range of different weather and lighting conditions.  The team called their new database DigiDogs, which was made up of 27,900 frames.They now plan to fine tune the system using Meta's DINOv2 model to make sure it can predict a 3D pose just as well from real dog pictures.  ""Our model was trained on CGI dogs, but we were able to use it to make 3D skeletal models from photographs of real animals,"" Ms Shooter said. ""That could let conservationists spot injured wildlife, or help artists create more realistic animals in the metaverse.

The HeraldThe ScotsmanDaily RecordThe Scottish SunDaily MailScottish Daily ExpressThe TimesThe TelegraphThe NationalThe CourierThe P&JGlasgow TimesEdinburgh News Wiltshire's chalk streams host a huge amount of wildlife and despite looking clear, they have been failing to meet ""good"" ecological health status. The Wylye Chalk Stream Project involves farmers, the Wessex Rivers Trust (WRT) and the Wiltshire Wildlife Trust (WWT).Alice Eley, WWT's water team manager, said: ""They [chalk streams] support very unique biodiversity.""The project, which Ms Eley said is of an ""unprecedented"" scale, has been funded by the government's Landscape Recovery scheme.Some of the wildlife supported by chalk streams and rivers in Wiltshire, such as in the Wylye Valley and Salisbury Plain, include salmon, brown trout, otters and water voles. Chalk streams come straight from the aquifer, a type of rock or sediment which holds groundwater, with the water filtered through the chalk, giving it unique features like a neutral temperature all year round.Ms Eley said the conditions helped certain plants to thrive, such as water crowfoot (Ranunculus), ""which is what these rivers are designated for,"" she added.""They [chalk streams] react very strongly to pollution. A small water quality change can have a devastating impact on chalk streams,"" Ms Eley said.Josh Stratton is one of the group of farmers in the area involved in the project - they want to return the river to it's natural course and closer to the environment that it would have enjoyed a century or two ago.On one stretch, he has put in gravel to make it shallow in parts, but also made deeper areas, as well as sections that are fast or slow-flowing.Changes like this provide a larger variety of habitats for wildlife, including improving conditions for fish spawning.""This land is almost post-agricultural so my tonnes per hectare of water voles will be increasing not my tonnes per hectare of wheat,"" explained Mr Stratton.He said he is excited about the project and pleased that the government has put in a framework, but said the science helps too: ""Having real scientists to make it work for farmers has helped. You can't expect farmers to do that in isolation.""The Wylye Chalk Stream Project is one of 34 successful schemes to come from the Landscape Recovery fund.Ms Eley said: ""Farmers are almost the lifeblood of the river - all of our rivers go through farmland. ""We want farmers to give rivers space - to grow, move, flood out, to do all the things a natural river should do.""It is not always possible because of development or good agricultural land, but where it can de done, it can benefit downstream.""

It would be the biggest ever rollout of new bathing water sites as part of the Government's plan to improve water quality across the country. ""This is a massive win for ordinary Taunton residents and users of our River Tone,"" said Mr Amos.""At last there will be proper monitoring of water quality and support and guidance for the many who swim in the river at French Weir, and recognition for something people have enjoyed as of right here for hundreds of years.""Janine Appleton added: ""I'm absolutely thrilled, as are the rest of the Friends of French Weir Park committee, at the news that we've reached the public consultation stage of our application for Bathing Water Status.

There have also been a spate of failures, including broken rails and signalling faults.The route is now set to be overhauled in three phases over 18 months.Thousands of runners have taken to the streets for an annual half marathon in Berkshire.About 3,500 competitors, including elite runners, began running the Wokingham Half Marathon at 10:00 GMT.Starting and finishing at Cantley Park, the race takes participants through the town centre, although a contingency route has been put in place this year due to flooding.Organisers said the event raises more than £100,000 for charity each year.Antlers on a life-size stag sculpture were sawn off in a spate of ""wanton vandalism"", a resident has said.Clean cut marks can be seen towards the base of each antler on the monument in Savernake Park, Bracknell, suggesting they were deliberately removed.Ken Toogood, one of those to spot the damage, said those responsible must have been ""clandestine"" and it looked ""premeditated"" given the use of tools.Were it not for a nearby sign, passers-by would have no clue what once stood on a grassy spot in Berkshire.Beside an arrow pointing to a campus gym, another points to the Imperial College Reactor Centre in Ascot.While the sports building is clearly visible, all that stands in front of it now is an open field.But for almost half a century, the patch of grass - not far from Ascot's world-famous racecourse and Legoland - was home to a nuclear reactor.Now, after 10 years' work, it has become the first civil nuclear site in Britain to be fully decommissioned - the point where regulators have been able to revoke its licence and end the strict controls imposed to protect the public.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Harri Barker has helped to bring saunas to the GowerThey are more commonly spotted in the corners of gyms and luxury hotels - but saunas are starting to pop up on the Welsh coast.Swansea's Gower peninsula in winter may seem like a strange place to relax in your swimsuit, but more and more people are visiting, keen to chase away the rainy day blues.It is the Scandinavian model being followed - where people can move from the cold of the sea, quickly to the warm. The British Sauna society (BSS) was set up almost 10 years ago with a focus on bringing the authentic sauna to the UK, and said numbers have doubled, with an increasing amount outside.It believes these could potentially replace pubs and community centres which are closing - but what is the appeal?‘’It is time away from your phone, time away from the rush of everyday life,"" Harri Barker told BBC Wales Live. ""It kind of brings you back to earth a little bit.’’ She set up Ty Sawna on the Gower in 2022, with one of they reasons being its connection to nature. ‘’That is what it's all about,’’ she added.‘’It can be sunny, raining, snowing or stormy, but you just sit in the sauna and it's like a portal that takes you somewhere else.’""It’s an activity which encourages others to get outside during the winter season.  ‘’When a lot of people find it really difficult to cope over the colder months, it’s a way to get people out and meeting new people.’’Scotland’s new wild sauna culture. Video, 00:01:53Scotland’s new wild sauna cultureBoxing Day swimmers fear sewage in seaWith two saunas at Oxwich Bay, Harri is on the sands at 06:00 most mornings during the winter, stoking the fire and setting up.Regular visitors include a group of cold water swimmers, and she said the combination of the hot and cold immersion keeps people coming back.  ‘’There is no feeling quite like it,"" Harri said.‘’It's just this buzz that you get, this natural high.’’It may be cold outside, but it is relaxing inside with a sea viewSecretary of the BSS Gabrielle Reason said there is a real difference between these saunas and the ones commonly seen in the UK.    ‘’The normal ones tend to be in the corner of a gym or in a hotel,"" she said.‘’People will sit in there, they'll get hot, uncomfortable and think 'that's enough'.‘’A lot of time if you go into a badly built sauna you don’t even access the benefits.’’She explained that the Finnish and Scandinavian style involves a more cyclical approach to the activity - moving from hot to cold and repeating this for up to an hour and a half.Gabrielle said that some research suggests this traditional sauna experience could be good for our physical health.    ‘’We are doing some of the same things for our body that exercise would do,"" she added.Gabrielle added some people have suggested it is like going into a therapy room, adding: ‘’When you look at what has been happening in the UK - the closing of pubs and community centres - I think it has potential to actually start replacing those things.’’Could saunas appear in more locations around the coast?‘’I would say the biggest benefit is a reduction in blood pressure,"" said Dr Tom Cullen, an assistant professor in Applied Physiology at Coventry University.‘’It’s particularly important in a Western society, where we're typically highly stressed and often have a poor diet.‘’You also see large improvements to vascular function as well.’’He has been studying the impact of heat therapy and the health benefits it can have, but stressed it cannot replace exercise.‘’If you compare things like weight loss, which is a real goal of lots of people that exercise, for example, you're not likely to see much benefit,"" Dr Cullen added.Ryan Stephens says you can meet people from all walks of lifeRyan Stephens is the founder of sea dipping group, the Wet Bandits, who are one of the regular visitors to Ty Sawna. ‘’The conversations you end up having in the sauna tend to be really deep, meaningful and are usually focused on health and wellbeing,’’ he said.‘’You meet people from all different walks of life.''It breaks down barriers and allows people to connect at a really genuine level.''It has become a favourite hobby of Oliver Bailey’It's so different compared to going to the pub or even going for a walk in the park,"" said cold dipper Oliver Bailey.‘’It really stands out. It's just wild.’’While Ty Sawna and many other outdoor saunas are currently on the coast, the BSS sees no reason why they cannot spread to other locations.‘’We want people to see this as a health activity like going to the gym or going to a yoga lesson,’’ secretary Gabrielle said.‘’I think a lot of the saunas cropping up have attracted white, middle class people but there's definitely people who are looking to push that.’‘’There are projects looking at getting social prescribers to start recommending it as a preventative health measure.’’https://www.britishsaunasociety.org.uk/https://www.outdoorswimmingsociety.com/ Pen-y-Bont in Abergele, Conwy, was relaunched on St David's Day after refurbishment, with what some called a ""slapdash translation"" of its name. The Bridge Head is now displayed prominently on signs, with its Welsh-language name appearing in smaller writing below.The BBC has contacted the owners to respond.""It disparages the Welsh language... this is some kind of slapdash translation, which is unacceptable,"" said local Dylan Rhys Jones.""You have the English translation in big letters and the Welsh name in small letters underneath.""I don't see the reason why they need to change the name.""Gareth Bolton, who also lives nearby, said the decision to ""rebrand the pub"" had attracted a lot of attention from local residents on social media.He said he was in favour of empty buildings being brought back to life but not ""mindlessly changing names from Welsh to English"".He pointed to another example - Y Gwindy being changed to The Winery, adding: ""At the end of the 19th century, Abergele had 16 pubs, all of them with an English name apart from Pen-Y-Bont and the Gwindy.""The names of these institutions are woven into local culture, identity and history.""The savage act of erasing our language is atrocious.""Language use has divided opinion, with some saying that where names are similar - such as Treorci/Treorchy or Caerffili/Caerphilly - the Welsh version only could be used.Some national parks have also moved to use Welsh names only, such as Eryri and Bannau Brycheiniog - formerly known as Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons respectively.In Eryri, Llyn Tegid has sometimes been known as Lake Bala, and Llyn Bochlwyd as Lake Australia.Should some place names be written only in Welsh?Translation error directs drivers to 'town egg gas'U-turn on street signs means they will be in Welsh Carwyn Powell said he felt ""stranded"" after Spot the collie disappeared. The Pet Abduction Bill will not apply to Wales as animal welfare is a devolved matter. The Welsh government said to ensure its resources have most impact in delivering its animal welfare plan, Wales will not be included in the bill.Currently, pet theft is classed under the Theft Act, meaning that a stolen pet is treated as inanimate property under the law. The Pet Abduction Bill, brought forward by Conservative MP Anna Firth, will make it a specific offence to abduct a pet in England and Northern Ireland.Under the new legislation, anyone convicted of the offence could face a fine or a maximum of five years in prison.But as animal welfare is a devolved matter, it is up to the Senedd to bring forward similar measures in Wales.Mr Powell's Collie, Spot, went missing in December 2018.Despite an extensive search, Spot has not been seen since. Mr Powell, 58, from Llanwrda, Carmarthenshire, said losing Spot was devastating.""It's like losing a member of the family,"" he said.""When we are doing something at home, you know there's somebody missing. When a dog's been stolen, there's no closure at all on it. You don't know what's happened to her.""Mr Powell said that the law as it stands was not strong enough to tackle pet thefts.""Something needs to be done about it because people are left just stranded really. There's no assistance coming from anywhere but in England and [Northern] Ireland now, they will have a bit of assistance if this bill goes through Parliament, but in Wales, there's nothing forthcoming.""A pet theft taskforce was set up following a rise in pet thefts during the pandemic, and an abduction bill was one of its recommendations. Former Welsh Secretary and MP for South Swindon, Sir Robert Buckland, who was a member of that taskforce, said: ""The trouble with the Theft Act is that it deals with property and a lot of people think of pets as more than just property. ""We want families to enjoy the protection of the law and that's why abduction is a much better way of looking at it than treating animals as mere property.""Sir Robert called on the Welsh government to enact a similar change, and said pet owners in Wales ""should not be put in a different position"" to those in other parts of the UK.Debbie Matthews, co-founder of the Stolen and Missing Pets Alliance, which began calling for reforms to the law a decade ago, said: ""It must be terribly worrying for the people in Wales.""I know Scotland are putting through a dog theft law, if Wales aren't, does that mean that Wales is going to become the hotspot for taking dogs and cats?""RSPCA Cymru is concerned that pets in Wales could be targeted more in other parts of the UK. Billie-Jade Thomas of RSPCA Cymru said: ""We hope that the Welsh government will continue to monitor the situation and that the decision that they have made is the result of an evidence-based approach.""RSPCA Cymru recommends the following measures for owners to safeguard their pets: A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""We want all animals to have a good quality life. We are delivering this through our programme of ambitious reforms set out in our animal welfare plan. ""Our focus is on areas which will bring greatest benefit to animal welfare across Wales, including our current consultation on licensing animal welfare establishments, exhibits and activities.   ""To ensure our resources have the maximum impact on animal welfare, Wales won't be included in the scope of the Pet Abductions Bill"".More on Politics Wales on BBC One Wales, Sunday, 10:00 GMT, and on iPlayerCat and dog theft set to be made criminal offenceMen who bred puppies in sheds in £300k ring jailedPolice use DNA profiling to stop dog thefts Bedford Borough Council said six buildings have now been repaired along the High Street where new paving was unveiled in 2021.The High Street Heritage Action Zone (HSHAZ) Programme began four years ago.Vincent Decamps, from Maison Le Vôtre, said he chose Bedford over St Albans as the place to open his patisserie and bakery because of the restorative work.He said the renovations to the High Street and Silver Street, where he is based, brought ""uniformity"" and marked a ""new start for Bedford"".When looking for a location ""the first goal was to go to St Albans"", he said, and when he first looked around Bedford it was ""a no, no"".""The only thing that attracted me to this position was the renovation of the building itself; if it was not restored I would have gone to St Albans, period, simple as that,"" he said.He said he ""took a massive risk"" and the area was now welcoming customers ""who haven't been in Bedford for two, three, four, five and six years"".The restoration programme, which started in January 2020, was a joint project between the council and Historic England, in partnership with Bedford BID and SEMLEP, and had been ""instrumental in preserving and enhancing the historic fabric of Bedford's town centre"", the council said. Two new businesses had moved into ""units that have been long term vacant"", the authority added.A new display celebrating its completion and featuring photographs, artwork, and information about the evolution of the town's High Street has opened at The Higgins Bedford - and runs until 1 April.Bedford's Evolving High Street exhibition ""offers a fascinating journey through the decades, showcasing the transformation and vitality of our beloved High Street"", the council said.

Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said ahead of the 6 March announcement that there was ""too much waste in the system"".As part of the reforms, AI will be used to cut NHS scan times by a third and the police will deploy drones to incidents such as traffic collisions.Labour said the package amounted to ""spin without substance"".Elsewhere, Mr Hunt also hinted that civil service staff numbers could be cuts by tens of thousands. The Treasury is hoping that the proposed technological reforms will deliver as much as £1.8bn worth of benefits to public sector productivity by 2029.""There is too much waste in the system and we want public servants to get back to doing what matters most: teaching our children, keeping us safe and treating us when we're sick,"" Mr Hunt said.""That's why our plan is about reaping the rewards of productivity, from faster access to MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) for patients to hundreds of thousands of police hours freed up to attend burglaries or incidents of domestic abuse.""The announcement comes as Mr Hunt is under mounting pressure from his Conservative colleagues to deliver tax cuts when he unveils his Budget on Wednesday.The Treasury said the latest move would mean 130,000 patients a year - including those waiting for cancer results - would receive their completed tests quicker as a result of at least 100 MRI scanners in England being upgraded with AI.In policing, it said the reforms would help to deliver on the Police Productivity Review, which it said found up to 38 million hours of officer time could be saved every year.Other key measures in the £800m investment include:Darren Jones, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Nothing in Britain is better off after 14 years of Conservative economic failure.""Millions of people are stuck on hospital waiting lists, our schools are crumbling and our streets are less safe. And yet all the chancellor is offering is more spin without substance.""The BBC's Faisal Islam said the Budget came at a time when the government was hoping to have scope to unveil voter-friendly tax cuts ahead of the general election.It initially hoped for ""headroom"" of about £30bn to spend at the start of the year after its borrowing costs fell sharply, but the BBC understands this figure returned to its November level of roughly £13bn by the middle of last month. Speaking to the Sunday Telegraph, Mr Hunt acknowledged the latest forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility had broadly ""gone against us"". ""So it's going to be a Budget where we stress... the importance of being responsible with the country's finances, because it's fundamentally unconservative to fund all the things that you would like to do by borrowing money for future generations,"" he said. Paul Jonson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told the BBC that any tax cut in the Budget was ""likely to be undone after the next election, whoever wins"". He added: ""Whatever the scale of the tax cut announced this week, during this parliament taxes will have risen very substantially indeed.""Mr Hunt also said the government would look to further cut public sector costs by reducing the number of staff in the civil service back to pre-pandemic levels.According to the Institute for Government, staff levels rose from around 423,000 at the start of 2020 to 496,150 in September last year.""You had a huge expansion of [the] civil service during the pandemic that was justified,"" the chancellor said.

Marco Longhi, a Conservative MP who represents Dudley North in the West Midlands, defended him and said he should not have been suspended from the party. He said there was no evidence his friend was Islamophobic or racist and that he should be re-instated.The Ashfield MP was suspended from the Tory party after he refused to apologise for the remarks, which the prime minister's official spokesperson said were wrong. Mr Longhi told Politics Midlands: ""I think where there might be a slight weakness in his argument is making an assertion that Sadiq Khan is closely associated to Islamist and therefore, by inference, an Islamist himself.""I think it's right that Lee works this out and I would like to see him return in the Conservative fold as soon as possible."" Lee Anderson has represented Ashfield since 2019Mr Longhi made the remarks during a debate about so-called no-go zones.Another Conservative MP, Paul Scully, apologised last week for suggesting there were ""no-go"" areas in parts of London's Tower Hamlets and Sparkill in Birmingham. The Dudley North MP said those comments were wrong but it did not show the Conservatives were out of touch. Mr Longhi said he represented a diverse community and there was not a corner of the United Kingdom he would personally describe as a no-go zone. ""We know that Britain's diversity is a great strength,"" added Mary Creagh, former MP for Wakefield, and Labour Party candidate for Coventry East.

Mr Hunt is under pressure from some Tory MPs to reduce taxes in Wednesday's Budget, ahead of an election which must be held by the end of January. A further cut to National Insurance is believed to be among the measures being considered by the chancellor.In an interview with the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme, Mr Hunt said the Budget, when the government sets out its plans for tax and spending, would be about ""long-term growth"". He said he also hoped to ""show a path"" towards a lower-tax economy. ""We've been very consistent, that we would only cut taxes in a way that was responsible and prudent,"" he said. ""The most unconservative thing I could do would be to cut taxes by increasing borrowing.""Overall the amount of tax people pay is still on course to reach record levels, despite the main rate of National Insurance being cut from 12% to 10% in last year's Autumn Statement. Mr Hunt has repeatedly hinted that he wants to reduce taxes further in the Budget but in recent weeks he has suggested there is likely to be less scope for this than he had hoped.  With only 72 hours until the Budget, Mr Hunt was firmly in the damping down expectations mode.At the start of this year, the government's independent economic forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), had estimated the chancellor had about £30bn of ""headroom"" to spend in the Budget, after borrowing costs fell sharply.Since then, borrowing costs have begun to rise again and by the middle of last month, the BBC understands the figure was back to its November level of roughly £13bn.With the government's spending rules and the OBR breathing down his neck on one side, and the Tory backbenches who want the historically high taxes cut, it is not a comfortable position. However, there is wide expectation at Westminster that he will reduce some taxes, even if the moves are not significant. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury Darren Jones said: ""The chancellor says he wants to cut taxes, but it is the Tories who have raised taxes to their highest level in 70 years. ""No matter what the chancellor does in the Budget this week, working people will be worse off thanks to 14 years of Tory failure.""Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank, told the BBC that any tax cut in the Budget was ""likely to be undone after the next election, whoever wins"".The IFS has also warned that further reducing taxes is likely to mean spending cuts in the future.Asked if the government should be spending more on public services, rather than tax cuts, Mr Hunt said: ""I think what most people want is better public services and a lower tax burden.""The only way that we have a chance of delivering something like that is by spending the money that we spend on public services much more efficiently.""  The government has already announced an £800m package of reforms aimed at freeing up NHS and police time, for example using Artificial Intelligence (AI) to cut NHS scan times and drones to assess incidents such as traffic collisions.Former chief economist at the Bank of England Andy Haldane told the programme he thought the government's self-imposed spending limits - known as ""fiscal rules"" - were ""stunting"" economic growth and constraining the chancellor's decisions.These include getting debt as a proportion of the size of the economy falling in five years. Mr Hunt said he did not agree the government should change its fiscal rules because ""people would interpret that as Britain losing control of its finances"". Recent memories of the meltdown in the financial markets following Liz Truss's mini-Budget in 2022 - which included £45bn of unfunded tax cuts - are a reminder of why such rules exist. But there does seem to be growing disquiet that the system that is meant to guarantee stability can have a negative impact too. Meanwhile, the chancellor is also considering other measures to raise revenue, including a new tax on vapes and scrapping non-dom tax status. People with non-domiciled status are UK residents whose home for tax purposes is abroad. Under the current system, they do not have to pay UK tax on money they make overseas.Mr Hunt has previously defended the tax status, arguing it helps make the UK an attractive place for well-off people to live and work. Labour has pledged to abolish non-dom status and spend the money generated on schools and the NHS. If the party backs any tax cuts the chancellor announces, which they are expected to do, this would leave questions over how some of their spending pledges would be funded.Mr Hunt refused to comment on any potential changes to specific taxes.However, he told the BBC: ""The country sees through gimmicks and we are not going to do gimmicks on Wednesday.""Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

Three Kent pits - Snowdown, Tilmanstone and Betteshanger - were in operation in 1984 when the 54-week dispute began.Protests were held against plans by the National Coal Board, supported by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to shut 20 ""unprofitable"" pits nationwide.The National Union of Miners' strike saw miners and police clash on the picket lines across the country.Eventually the Kent miners returned to work but the pits were destined for closure. Betteshanger was the last to close in Kent in 1989.Shaun Parry started working at Snowdown Colliery near Aylesham when he was just 16 years old. He said: ""It was 940m deep, and it was very, very hot. I think the nickname was Dante's inferno. I loved it.""Mr Parry said he had been detained by police during the strike. ""I hadn't done anything. I was taken to the van and then they cable-tied you to a wire inside the van,"" he said.""I was frightened. I was really frightened."" Kay Sutcliffe was married to miner Philip Sutcliffe and they lived in the pit village of Aylesham. She said no-one in the village broke the strike and everyone in Aylesham was ""organised and united"".For Mrs Sutcliffe, the strikes were a battle to save not just jobs, but a way of life. After seeing TV reports of miners' wives in Nottinghamshire calling for a return to work, women in Kent, led by Mrs Sutcliffe and others, travelled north to boost support for the stoppage.She penned poems which galvanized dozens of women to march in protest, while her speeches were heard by thousands. Mrs Sutcliffe said: ""I think we were the first women support group that actually publicly were noticed for doing an active thing like that.""'How is it gonna affect the miners in our community? How is it gonna affect their families if they can't get a job anywhere?' That's the kind of thing I was talking about,"" she told BBC Politics South East. ""And how much it meant to our communities to keep the pits going, and not just to our communities, but to the whole country."" Follow BBC South East on Facebook, on X, and on Instagram.

The Alverstoke sea defences, in the pipeline since 2015, would see the flood risk reduced for 142 homes and businesses. Seafield was also highlighted as one of the three priority areas for a flood defence scheme with 80 homes and businesses at risk, but it has an £800,000 funding gap.Council leader Peter Chegwyn said he wanted the government to provide extra money.Coastal Partners was formed in 2012 to deliver a coastal management service across the coastlines of the local authorities in Havant, Portsmouth, Gosport, Chichester, and Fareham.Follow BBC South on Facebook, X, or Instagram.

Jersey Post said the stamps capture the ""enduring spirit of the RNLI"".A lifeboat was first established in Jersey in 1830, with a volunteer team and a boat, kept near Havre des Pas. In 1884, the RNLI station in St. Helier was built at Albert Quay, where it still serves as the Island's RNLI headquarters. Images chosen for the Jersey stamps include St Heliers Tamar class lifeboat, the dramatic scenes of the rescue of the yacht Fanny and Sir William Hillary, who founded the RNLI in 1824.Jersey Post said the stamps were a tribute to the ""generations of courageous volunteers and the generosity of those who give to support their vital life-saving work"".The release includes a booklet featuring further information about Jersey RNLI.The stamps will be available to buy from all branches of Jersey Post from 4 March.

Having spent the past five years on the idea, he said support for the project has now gathered. Mr Martyn cofounded the Connect 3 Million campaign, external to build the sub-seabed link in 2019, and the group has been lobbying decision-makers and politicians since.The Faroe Islands to the north of Scotland have a population of about 53,000 and spent hundreds of millions of pounds on a subsea tunnel network.A rail tunnel between Guernsey and France via Jersey would cost an estimated £5.6bn and take up to 10 years to build, according to the campaign group. Mr Dorey said making it easier for people to reach the Channel Islands would ""transform the future for everyone"". ""Our economies are strong but are being held back when we all need them to expand further. ""This innovation will herald a boom across financial services, tourism and beyond”.The roadshows are being held on 5 March in Jersey and 6 March in Guernsey.  Speakers due to attend the roadshows include tunnelling experts Arild Sovik, network director of the Norwegian Tunnelling Society and Teitur Samuelsen, chief executive of the Faroe Islands’ public company.Connect 3 Million said the speakers will share  how the economic, social and cultural benefits the tunnels have brought to the Faroe Islands, can be replicated for the Channel Islands.

He added: ""One thing I've realised is that the more authentic you are with how you feel about subjects like the Knife Angel - putting knives down and making people aware of the violence that goes on in their city - it makes people want to be more authentic themselves.""When I started, I thought people were going to think certain things about me. But I think it's down to your perception and how you view life.""If I think that, I come from a more authentic place with my music.""The album was inspired by the Knife Angel project in Gloucester - a statue made of knives that young people had surrendered. The group made the music for the launch of the sculpture last year, and then went on to make the album.Mikel Medley, youth support manager for The Music Works, said it had been ""life-changing"" for the participants.""Some of them have said they wouldn't know where they would be in their life if they wasn't doing music,"" he said. ""They probably would have got themselves into trouble or not be in a good well-being space.""Coby, who does marketing for the project, said: ""To me, it was really important just because I got to convey a lot of the stuff that isn't spoken about so much. ""I think when it comes to the topic of knife crime we often talk about the fallout of what happens when all of these things come to a head.""No one wants to address how we can limit the fallout that comes from kids not getting the right the opportunities or given the right belief systems that lets them steer away from that to begin with.""I think this is a perfect embodiment of what can happen when you tell young people in general that they're capable of doing something more than what's expected of them based on societal norms.""Jayden, 15, who was also involved in the project, added: ""Having something like a second family to come to, it's definitely helped me focus and improve my life.""Follow BBC West on Facebook, X and Instagram.

Teenagers in Worcestershire told the BBC Politics Midlands programme that home study during lockdown, and increased stress, had left many struggling to cope with school routine.The council said it continued to work to support pupils and parents and ""remove any barriers"" preventing attendance.Overall attendance in the autumn had been up on last year, the authority added.At Baxter College in Kidderminster, where there are 900 students, the overall attendance rate remains 4% down on pre-pandemic levels, according to the principal.One pupil there said students were struggling to readjust after the absence enforced by Covid, with one day off easily stretching into more now things were back to normal.  “At the start of the week people say ‘oh I’ll just miss the one day’,"" explained Tom, 18, a sixth form student.""And then we get to Friday and people are like ‘I’ll have a long weekend'.”Tom said he believed home study during lockdowns made many unused to school routine. “Now suddenly everyone’s being told what to do, when you can eat, when you can go home - it’s definitely been a shock,"" he told the programme.Fellow student Katie, 17, added: “School got re-introduced and I felt like people couldn’t be bothered to come back in, because they felt 'if I can do this at home, surely there’s no need'.”Another 17-year-old, Tegan, said: “My attendance has definitely dropped. I feel like I personally don’t mind working from home, and I work better in the evenings."" The number of pupils persistently absent from school in Worcestershire has not returned to pre-pandemic levelsPrincipal Mat Carpenter said the drop-off was more marked in students on free school meals.Attendance was “not just a school problem"", he said, but a matter for support services and parents too. Additionally, the number of pupils missing more than half of school has risen sharply at Baxter College.“Where previously we would have one or two [pupils like that] in the whole school… we’re now looking at up to 6%,” Mr Carpenter said.Baxter College is not unique in the county. With a secondary school population of more than 36,000, an estimated 23.9% - 8,650 students - in Worcestershire have missed at least 10% of school days so far this academic year. Baxter's principal, Mat Carpenter, and the school's wellbeing lead, Stacey Hannan, said schools needed more support to raise attendanceBaxter’s wellbeing lead Stacey Hannan - who is leading efforts to build relationships with families - admitted progress could be slow.“It could take six to eight weeks of home visits, telephone conversations with parents, and meetings,” she explained.She said the long referral waits students faced for mental health support or neurodiversity assessments meant that often schools were limited in the help they could give.“I think the system in both of those areas is creaking”, added Mr Carpenter, calling for substantial investment.Keira, 15, praised the pastoral care offered at Kidderminster & District Youth Trust, and said she did not feel like she was being judged as in schoolFor 15-year-old Keira, who is not currently in mainstream education, “mental health is the main issue"" for being an absentee, along with a lack of support for such challenges.“I started to not go in as often… my mum kept pulling me out because of how bad I was getting,"" she said of her experience.After being referred to Kidderminster & District Youth Trust, she now has a weekly meeting with mentor Maisie Cook, who says she offers an ""open space"" for teenagers to talk about their emotions and education. Speaking generally, Ms Cook said: ""We see a lot of young people who have a lot going on behind closed doors. Covid has been massive.""Former Schools minister Robin Walker MP said more investment was needed for a rising level of neurodiverse studentsLast year, a cross-party group of MPs called for the government to offer better support for pupils and schools.“I think I’d give them an A for effort, but they’re not there on achievement yet,” said Worcester's Conservative MP Robin Walker, chair of the House of Commons Education Select Committee. Tracey Onslow, cabinet member for education at Worcestershire County Council, said: ""We continue to work closely with education settings across the county to support pupils and parents, and where possible, remove any barriers preventing regular attendance.""Herefordshire and Worcestershire Health and Care Trust said it was working with schools and said it carried out weekly reviews of absent children.  It added it worked to identify health concerns that may lead or contribute to school absence.  Follow BBC West Midlands on Facebook, external, X, external and Instagram, external.

Kent Wildlife Trust said the mix of longhorns and Sussex cows were welcomed to Scotney Castle, near Tunbridge Wells, on Thursday to create a ""wilder, more biodiverse"" area.Rebecca Rees, the castle's manager, said they were ""thrilled"" to be working with the trust on the initiative.Castle archives show the first Scotney herd was introduced in 1896.The trust said the grounds of the 14th-century castle and Victorian country mansion included a large, wooded estate where the cattle will work alongside an existing flock of sheep to enhance the National Trust's wilder grazing plans for the site.Ms Rees said: ""The diverse features of the 780-acre estate at Scotney makes it a haven for wildlife and our ambition is to help it thrive.""She added conservation grazing on the SSSI (site of special scientific interest) will result in an increase of habitat that supports the native wildlife of Kent.

It also comes at a time when passengers have faced disruption to services due to strikes by rail workers over the past 18 months.Traditionally, fares are hiked based on July's retail prices index measure of inflation, which in 2023 was 9%, plus an additional 1%.However, the increase in fares has been capped below this rate, and is lower than last year.Regulated fares cover about 45% of fares, including season tickets on most commuter journeys, some off-peak return tickets on long-distance journeys and anytime tickets around major cities.For example, if the 4.9% increase is applied, an annual season ticket from Brighton to London would jump £275 to £5,891, while one from York to Leeds would go up £135 to £2,899. While some people may have tried to buy their season tickets just before the price rise, here are five tips for getting the cheapest deals at any time of the year.Advance train tickets are usually released up to 12 weeks before your departure date, although some go on sale as far as 24 weeks in advance. These types of tickets are often the cheapest way to travel on the railways if you're happy to go during a fixed time. Sometimes they can be available to buy up to an hour before your journey.Personal finance website Money Saving Expert says that London North Eastern Railway (LNER) often releases advance tickets up to six months ahead for routes from stations north of York to London.Some ticket purchasing apps can send alerts to your phone as soon as tickets for a specified journey go on sale. Split ticketing means you can take the same number of trains you normally would for your journey, but can save money by splitting your journey into multiple tickets between the stations the service stops at on the way.Some websites like Split My Fare and Split Train Tickets do it for you without you having to work it out.Split My Fare says on average, customers save 26% by doing this - although it's not always possible on some journeys. Also, checking to see whether it is cheaper to buy two single tickets rather than a return might save you money.  Rail cards can offer discounts when booking, though they cost money to purchase in the first place, so benefit those who travel often.There are several types of rail card available: national, regional, those for students and those for pensioners. For example, the 16-25 Railcard costs £30, is valid for one year and gives you one third off each ticket you buy.More information on the different types of railcard are here.You can get up to a third off the ticket price when travelling in groups of three to nine adults off-peak.The group must be travelling together, and individual rail cards cannot be used when booking a group ticket. Groups of over 10 people can also get discounts - contact the train company directly for those. Group off-peak day travelcards for London are also available, but the origin station on the ticket needs to be in fare zones one to nine.National flexible rail tickets could save passengers hundreds of pounds, says watchdog Transport Focus. The flexible season tickets will allow travel on any eight days in a 28-day period, with no need to select the days of travel in advance. Train companies have also introduced a range of flexible tickets aimed at commuters and workers who have seen their travel patterns change post-pandemic.  The Flexi Season ticket will offer a minimum of 20% discount on an equivalent monthly season ticket, according to National Rail.For those making the same journey multiple times in a week regularly, monthly or season tickets can be cheaper. Check with your employer to see if they offer a season ticket loan to help you spread the cost, interest free.Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

Planning permission was granted in 2022 for offices and a café on the neighbouring site of the historic Western Park Open Air School, which fell into disrepair after becoming the target of vandals and arsonists in the 17 years since it closed.That plan was met with a number of objections from the local community.Key concerns about the latest plan include the loss of park land, the loss of the car park, traffic and parking concerns and the harm to wildlife.A handful of supporting comments were also submitted, with those in favour saying it was good the council was doing this on brownfield land and it would help tackle anti-social behaviour to which some said the car park is ""prone"".Planning officers say the proposal has an ""exemplary and innovative design which should be welcomed"" and the new homes would help meet housing needs.In order to create space for the new homes, the Constance Jackson Centre, Parkfield and Club House buildings would be demolished, the Local Democracy Reporting Service said.Planning officers labelled the loss of the car park ""regrettable"" when it comes to the convenience of park users. However, they said there would still be ""informal"" parking for them along the park's main access road.The applicant will also be requested to make financial contributions towards improvements at Western Park, which includes improving the basketball facilities.Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.

All 340 people on board lost their lives.The aircraft came down just minutes after take-off from Paris at 12:35 GMT and scythed a mile-long trail through the forest of Ermenonville near the French capital.Among the victims were 200 passengers, many of them British, who had been transferred from British Airways flights cancelled because of a strike by engineers at London airport.""They are very much part of the fabric of our club,"" said Mr Germeney.""It is important that we remember the 50-year anniversary.

The conservation work began in 2022, which meant one side of the cathedral was hidden by scaffolding. Now it has been taken down and visitors have full access to the garden overlooking the River Wear.The expert team removed stones in bad condition and carved new stones to make them the right shape and size, before securing them into the wall with lime mortar.The Monks' Garden became enclosed when the Galilee Chapel was built in the 12th Century and was used by novice monks in their leisure time.After the dissolution of the monasteries in the 16th Century, the bowling green became a garden for the clergy.Gary Holliday, stonemason supervisor, said: ""Although it has been a challenging and lengthy process, working in all weather, the most satisfying parts of the project have been in the workshop cutting stones to our templates. ""Once we completed these we carefully moved them on to the site and fixed them in place.

""Some daft immaturity came over me and I was a bit unsure, as I took my seat next to Dave Myers, the lad with alopecia. ""He was completely welcoming and friendly, and we hit it off with a shared passion for art.""Here began the lifelong friendship that took us to flat sharing in London to pursue our fine art degrees and all the adventures ahead.""After school, the pair ended up as flatmates in Peckham, London. When they would travel back to Barrow to visit family and friends, Mr Twyford recalls Myers and Peter Thompson going to the market for fresh food and cooking up a feast for them all. ""Dave and Pete would cook for us until the early hours of the morning, all adventurous dishes,"" he said.""He was very loveable, full of enthusiasm, the same off-screen as on-screen. ""I loved Dave, he always had some adventurous plan he was going to try.""He was just full of enthusiasm and a zest for life.""His favourite memory from their enduring friendship was going to Brixton to a big motorbike warehouse and Myers buying his first ever bike.However, he did not have a licence and Graham had to drive it, with Myers in the sidecar. When Myers got his licence, the pals went on trips back to Cumbria from London.Graham said: ""I remember it was a Cossack Ural 650cc with a sidecar.""The picture was taken on an early trip up to the Lakes from London in 1978.""We took it in turns to ride the bike with one helmet between us.""Cumbria is one of the top culinary destinations outside London, with a total of 16 Michelin Stars across 13 restaurants.Simon Rogan runs L'Enclume restaurant in Cartmel, south Cumbria, which has three stars.He said Myers was a great ambassador for the county and helped grow its culinary reputation. ""He was always shouting from the rooftops about the produce and the people and he had a genuine love for the area,"" Mr Rogan said.""I think he was proud of the restaurant scene and what was going on in the North West, predominantly in Cumbria.""Myers also lived in Roa Island for many years.It is just over half a mile (1 km) south of the village of Rampside, at the southern most point of the Furness Peninsula in Westmorland and Furness and has a population of about 100.It is a tight-knit community and friends and neighbours are saddened by his loss, but remember the TV personality fondly.Former neighbour, Ian Honeyman said: ""It's sad news, I knew he'd been ill but I didn't realise it was as serious as that. ""We were both born in Devon Street and we used to joke about which part of the street did we come from, was it the rough end, that kind of thing.""He never forgot Cumbria and I think he did such marvellous work publicising it, which was great.""He was a real natural comic and such a lovely guy.""Even those who did not know him personally were struck by his natural warmth and down to earth nature when they met him in the flesh.During a trip to Glenridding in the Lake District a couple of years ago, Olivia Clarke spotted two big motorbikes in a car park and her hopes were raised that they might belong to her two biking and cooking heroes. She said: ""We had a couple of minutes chat. They weren't filming, they were just on a boys' jolly, having lunch."" Ms Clarke said her overriding memory of the encounter was the pair's chemistry.""It just stuck with me because their energy, even off-screen, was there, this was well before Dave was ill,"" she said.""He had this smiley face, this look on him, this swagger and you just knew you could talk to him."" She said Myers' and King's connection was ""spectacular"".""They didn't just turn the magic on, it was real and they actually finished each other's sentences, like an old married couple or a pair of comfy shoes.""Malcolm Flynn, who was another one of chef's neighbours when he lived on Roa Island, said he regularly took photographs of the town and sent them to Myers.He said: ""I'd often walked round the park or go on the bridge and take shots for Dave and send them to him. ""If you saw him he would always stop and speak, he always had the time and was always cheerful.""He was a true Barrovian and we will miss him.""Follow BBC Cumbria on Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.

The hearing, which was held between between 21 and 23 February, considered incidents from between 2018 and 2020.Simeon Wallis presented the Nursing and Midwifery Council's case, saying Mr Ainsworth's dishonesty was ""not limited to a single occasion"".Mr Wallis said the former director's actions were serious and effectively an attempt to evade responsibility for situations in which a direct risk of harm to patients had been created by an error of his judgement, even though no harm materialised.The panel said in January 2019 Mr Ainsworth failed to refer a child with sepsis, referred to as Patient A, instead providing the wrong information to the patient's mother and sent them to a pharmacy.Mr Ainsworth did not make a record of the conversation, and falsely reported that Patient's A's rash ""did fade"" and that the patient's mother declined a review, the panel added.In September 2019, the panel said Mr Ainsworth incorrectly interpreted the blood test results of another patient, asking them to attend a repeat blood test ""when they should have been asked to go to A&E immediately"".The trust issued a statement to confirm Mr Ainsworth had resigned from his role as director of strategy and partnerships, saying he ""leaves with our best wishes and we thank him for all that he achieved during his time with the trust"".Follow BBC East Midlands on Facebook, on X, or on Instagram.
